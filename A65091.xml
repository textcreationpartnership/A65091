            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It now requires great skill, to place and ≈øet every thing in its due order.</p>
            <p>Your Honours have a great work to do, God hath broken us in pieces, and divided our Councels, and none can unite us, but he that hath wounded us, he only mu≈øt cure us, and ble≈øs and ≈øanctifie all lawful means, or
<pb facs="tcp:62073:3"/> el≈øe our disjoynted bones will never be truly knit, or exactly ≈øet.</p>
            <p>For this end hath God apointed a ≈øelect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honourable per≈øons, of which number your Honours are Members, who≈øe heart God hath fixed for this great Work, to revive the ≈øtones out of the heap of rubbi≈øh, and to build the Walls of our <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> though the <hi>Sanballats, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> be worth, and con≈øpire altogether to fight again≈øt <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> to hinder this VVork.</p>
            <p>Right Honourable, if you will fini≈øh this good VVork you have begun, you mu≈øt do as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, keep good watch day and night, becau≈øe of your enemies, le≈øt your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øaries ≈øerve you, as they ≈øerved <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> for they ≈øay you ≈øhall not know nor ≈øee till we come in the mid≈øt among≈øt them, and ≈ølay them, and cau≈øe the work to cea≈øe, if this be not prevented, this Parliament will have a fatal end.</p>
            <p>Pre≈øidents in Courts of Ju≈øtice is a great Guide to all ju≈øt Judges, e≈øpecially when they have been made by the Grave and Learned,
<pb facs="tcp:62073:3"/> and are recorded in the Sacred Bible, the chiefe≈øt Book that every good State≈øman walks by; ≈øuch State≈ømen that walks by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavels</hi> rules, the wicked <hi>Maximes</hi> of the≈øe trouble≈øom times, they do as <hi>Saul</hi> did when he left God, and went to the VVitch of <hi>Endor,</hi> he pretended to go to ≈øpeak with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and met with the devil, ≈øo the≈øe times have produced many a Fa≈øt, the pretence hath bin to ≈øeek God and Peace, when the true end hath bin to get to be the Head of a Party and Faction, to make divi≈øion, and to get the Peoples money: The People are now very well acquainted with ≈øuch canting, and as we know after a fla≈øh of lightning, there comes a clap of thunder, ≈øo hath it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fallen out, after Fa≈øts hath followed an erecting of an High Court of Ju≈øtice, or one remarkable oppre≈ø≈øion or other.</p>
            <p>I humbly pre≈øent you here in this Epi≈øtle, with a good Pre≈øident made by a great State≈øman <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ≈øuch a one as God hath recorded was a Saviour of his Countrey, a Builder up of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> in the like ca≈øe, and
<pb facs="tcp:62073:4"/> in the like ≈øtraits as it is now, or ≈øuddenly without Gods infinite mercy will be vvith us, he took this cour≈øe. In the fir≈øt place, he ≈øought God, and prayed before the God of Heaven, and did not make a mock-Fa≈øt; then he u≈øed the means, he fell to his VVork, and built up the walls of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and did not only build, but he built wi≈øely and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly, and had there bin a <hi>Sanballat</hi> found among≈øt them, the people would have ≈øtoned him.</p>
            <p>On the lovver places behind the vvall, and on the higher places, he ≈øet the people after their families, vvith their ≈øvvords, their ≈øpears and their bovves; and vvhen he had ≈øet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in a po≈øture of defence, he made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be his Guard, and delivered an Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Rulers and People, ≈øaying, <hi>Be not afraid of your enemies, remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your ≈øonnes and your daughters, your wives and your hou≈øes.</hi>

            <p>I ≈øhall humbly de≈øire your Honours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, vvhat vvas the effect of this orderly

            <p>But all ha≈øty and unadvi≈øed attempts at long running brings the Common-wealth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great danger, and the Actors generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt and mi≈øery, many men in their de≈øignes thinking to catch a great Fi≈øh, but after long angling bring up a Frog; this daily experience hath ≈øhewed, and I can experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally ≈øay it to be true.</p>

               <p>The Council of State upon the con≈øiderations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid, and to incourage your Petitioner to proceed, they did faithfully promi≈øe your Petitioner for this his ≈øervice and di≈øcovery, that your Petitioner ≈øhould be paid the ≈øum of eleven thou≈øand pounds out of the ≈øilver that ≈øhould be taken out of the≈øe ≈øhips, and converted to the u≈øe of the Common-wealth, this ≈øumme of eleven thou≈øand pounds, being the value of your Petitioners E≈øtate, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62073:12"/> the Parliament 1643. upon mis-information again≈øt your Petitioner had ≈øeque≈øtred.</p>
               <p>And the Council of State declared unto your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, That if your Petitioner ≈øhould fail to make good his undertaking in di≈øproving the Spani≈øh and Flemi≈øh Claims to all this ≈øilver, then aboard the ≈øhips <hi>Samp≈øon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> that the undertaking would undo your Petitioner; for upon your Petitioners failing to make good proof of what he had undertaken, the Councel of State would report your Petitioner to the Parliament to be an Incendiary, therefore it highly concerned your Petitioner to be well a≈ø≈øured of what he had undertaken, and al≈øo to be ju≈øtly dealt withal when he had done this ≈øervice.</p>
               <p>Upon the a≈ø≈øurance of the Councel of State upon the afore≈øaid termes, your Petitioner engaged and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this great, difficult, and dangerous ≈øervice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Petitioner employed above ten ≈øeveral per≈øons, for about two years, and laid out of Pur≈øe, be≈øides all his time and hazard, the ≈øumme of above ≈øeven hundred ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five pounds, which he payes intere≈øt for at this very day, as is depo≈øed by ≈øeveral Witne≈ø≈øes whom your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners employed in this ≈øervice, and this is atte≈øted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of ≈øeveral Honourable Per≈øons, to the late Lord Protector <hi>Oliver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May it plea≈øe your Honours, be≈øides this ≈øervice your Petitioner did for the Common-wealth, he di≈øcovered to the Councel of State, in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1651. That from <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62073:12"/> to <hi>December</hi> 20. 1652. the Admiralty had di≈øcharged fifty eight ≈øhips, all loaden with rich merchandize, I printed the ≈øeveral daies of the moneth they were cleared out of the Court of Admiralty, the names of the ≈øhips, and the Ma≈øter of the ≈øhips names, and the parties to whom the≈øe ≈øhips and merchandize was delivered at <hi>London;</hi> and that many of the≈øe ≈øhips after their di≈øcharge from hence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded their merchandize at <hi>Am≈øterdam</hi> for the account of the Dutch, to the value of many hundred thou≈øand pounds.</p>
               <p>Upon examination of this Bu≈øine≈øs, the Council of State had certain intelligence from beyond ≈øea that this information was true, and the≈øe Letters were remaining in Captain <hi>Bi≈øheps</hi> hands who can te≈øtifie the truth. Whereupon your Petitioner humbly pre≈øented to the Council of State in writing ≈øeveral waies for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this abu≈øe for the future, and the Judges in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie was removed, and other Iudges put in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with particular in≈øtructions for the prevention of the former frauds put on the Nation.</p>
               <p>By which di≈øcovery made by your Petitioner, the Common-wealth got many ≈øcore prizes, which were condemned as Dutch prizes, when they could not bring atte≈øtations from <hi>Hamborough</hi> under the Parliament Agents hands, <hi>viz</hi> Mr <hi>Brad≈øhaws,</hi> that they really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonged to <hi>Hamborough.</hi> The value of the Ships and goods by your Petitioners means di≈øcovered was amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ≈øeveral ≈øcore of thou≈øand pounds, be≈øides all the ≈øilver your Petitioner ≈øtayed, which the Dutch had cozen.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62073:13"/> ed us of, had not your Petitioner acquainted the Council in <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1652 with the former cheats put on the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in printing a li≈øt of 58 Saile of ≈øhips, mo≈øt of them Dutch prize, which the Common-wealth lo≈øt, for want of keeping a good Watch on the Actions of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Officers in the Admiralty in tho≈øe times 1652. 1653. It was nothing for ordinary Proctors in the Admiralty to get foure of five thou≈øand pounds a yeare, by cozening the State in their prizes, till your Petitioner by his di≈øcovery to the Councel of State, ≈øpoiled their Trade for a great part of it. This di≈øcovery got your Petitioner the envy of many hundred Merchants, and others in the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>There was not a motion, nor any Proceedings in the Court of Admiralty, for about three yeares, touching the Silver Ships <hi>Samp≈øon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> their ≈øilver and lading, but every day your Petitioner was required to give his attendance therein, at the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and forced to employ at his own charge many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons; and your Petitioner was required by Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> at his own charge to employ many per≈øons to breviate and have in≈øpection into all the Records, Acts, Bills of lading, Pleas, Extracts, Allegations, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, Witne≈ø≈øes, Depo≈øitions in the Silver bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, as will appear under the hands of ≈øeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons employed and paid by your Petitioner for that ≈øervice.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner did ≈øeveral times move the Councel of State, in <hi>December, January, February, March</hi> 1652.

               </p>
               <p>Your Petitioner pre≈øented to the Councel of State, in 1652. 1653. ≈øeveral frauds and abu≈øes put upon the Common-wealth, in the Sale of their Prizes, Ships, and Merchandize, by the indirect meanes of ≈øome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers they intru≈øted to ≈øell the ≈øame, ≈øometimes the State hath been cheated fourty in the hundred, to the value of many ≈øcore of thou≈øand pounds in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>

(And by your Petitioners di≈øcovery of the abu≈øes for the ≈øervice of the State, he had contracted the envie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny guilty per≈øons) Thereupon to ≈øhew to the world, what I had delivered in private to the afore≈øaid per≈øons was true, and that I would ju≈øtifie what I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of privately, I printed the ≈øeveral frauds and cheats put upon the Nation by ≈øome of the Commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for prize Goods, and ≈øome of their Officers and Agents, and demon≈øtrated ≈øeveral wayes for the State to

               <p>Your Petitioner by order of Parliament, as appears by your Records of the Hou≈øe, for ≈øeveral yeares was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to follow and ≈øolicite the getting of an Act to pa≈ø≈øe again≈øt tran≈øporting Gold and Silver.

               <p>But the guilty per≈øons were then ≈øo powerfull in the Councills of the Parliament, that though the Parliament made ≈øeveral Committees of the Hou≈øe and Council of State, for the perfecting the Act and for di≈øcovery of the offenders, and referred the matter thereof to the con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Commi≈øsioners of the Navy, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Mint, and Farmers of the Cu≈øtomes, who all of them have certified the Parliament of the great mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and dammage the Common-wealth ≈øuffered by ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral evil-di≈øpo≈øed per≈øons, who for private lucre and gain daily tran≈øported the Gold and Silver of the Nation, to the un≈øpeakable damage of the Common-wealth. This Bill being twice read in the Hou≈øe, and ≈øeveral times committed, yet by the power of ≈øome guilty Merchants, this good Act was ≈øtopt, ≈ømothered and ≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62073:14"/> and never fini≈øht, though your Petitioner attended many yeares at his great expence and charges to have this good Act pa≈øt, (And now at this day it is apparent to all people,) that you cannot receive in the payment of a thou≈øand pounds twenty ≈øhillings in Gold, no Gold being ≈øtirring in the Nation, but in the hands of Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, Rooks, and Gold≈ømiths, they ≈øelling a twenty ≈øhillings piece in Gold for two ≈øhillings in the pound, more then the price current by Proclamation, which is again≈øt the Statute of the fifth and ≈øixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ≈øixth.

I ≈øurveyed; and 4 pence for every pound weight Venice, for all the Gold and Silver Thread I ≈øealed with the Seal of my Office, being the Ro≈øe and Crown. And all that time the gold and ≈øilver Lace, was as good Silver and as duly a≈ø≈øaied as the

               <p n="7">7.

                              <p>But if the Pa≈ø≈øengers did confe≈ø≈øe this Silver to be loaden, a great part of it for the accompt of Merchants of <hi>An≈øterdam,</hi> as I had undertaken they would do, then hee would improve that Te≈øtimony to the uttermo≈øt for the States advantage, which indeed Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> did.</p>
                              <p>And I proved the≈øe frauds by the te≈øtimony of about ten of the Pa≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, being all Dutchmen, <hi>Hamburgers</hi> and <hi>Lubeccars,</hi> and other Han≈ø-towns men; and I had above four≈øcore witne≈ø≈øes the Pa≈ø≈øengers and Merchants more to examine in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, many of them were after packed away by the Claimers, being Dutch marriners, and had money given them that they ≈øhould keep out of the way and not be examined, and ≈øeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes waited many daies to be examined in the Admiralty and could not.</p>
                              <p>Spani≈øh Gold and Silver was plentifully be≈øtowed on ≈øome in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, and they loved it well. The Claimers had their In≈øtruments almo≈øt every night that ≈øtole ≈øilver out of the≈øe ≈øhips, to the value of many ≈øcore thou≈øand pounds, which I di≈øcovered to the Councel of State, as appeared by ≈øeveral papers which I pre≈øented to them.</p>
                              <p>I imployed ≈øeveral men who ≈øpake the Dutch Language at my own charge, and gave them money to go on ≈øhip-board, and to drink freely with the Dutch marriners, and in their cups to fi≈øh out the ≈øecrets of this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and when I had once got the end of the ≈øtring, I would by other engines and in≈øtruments clo≈øely follow and never give it over till I knew the whole bottom of the Flemmi≈øh and Spani≈øh cheats which they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put upon the Nation.</p>
                              <p>The≈øe men that I imployed on ≈øhip-board for to make this Di≈øcovery for mee never appeared to mee in the Admiralty, le≈øt the Spani≈øh and Dutch Merchants and marriners ≈øhould have di≈øcovered them to have been my ≈øpies. And to deal clearly with your Honours, they were none of them Book-men, Civilians, nor Lawyers, but ≈øuch per≈øons as be-<hi>skellom'd</hi> mee ≈øoundly in their cups with the Dutch marriners; and though I paid for the <hi>Brandey</hi>-wine, ≈øtrong beer, Mum, and Spruce beere, pickle Herrings and Holland chee≈øe, yet I never ex≈øpected from them good word or peny of money for all this charge and pains.</p>
                              <p>If I were to do the like ≈øervice again for the State, I would never look in any Books of the Civil Law, but con≈øult with ≈øuch per≈øons as know how to humour a Dutch Skipper or marriner, and fi≈øh out his ≈øecrets. Thus have I clearly told you the waies and in≈øtruments I u≈øed to do the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth this great ≈øervice. I now humbly ex≈øpect according to the Councel of States promi≈øe the ≈øumme of eleven thou≈øand pounds for this ≈øervice. And had I not undertaken it the Common-wealth had lo≈øt this Silver, which was to the value of two hundred ≈øeventy eight thou≈øand pounds.</p>
                           </note> This that he de≈øires being just, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire that you would not put him off, but let it be done forthwith unto him≈øelf, and all ≈øuch others as he under his hand ≈øhall nominate; for he employes others under him in ≈øearching into this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. He will nominate none but ≈øuch as may be tru≈øted in it. And I de≈øire you in your ≈øeveral places to give him, and all that he ≈øhall employ, all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy di≈øpatch and encouragement, that the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of the Common-wealth may finde no ob≈øtacle. Where there is publication, you may likewi≈øe ≈øhew him the Depo≈øitions and (I pray) let nothing that is ju≈øt be denied him.</hi>

               <p>This ≈øame Letter, which the≈øe afore≈øaid Referrees writ to the Lord <hi>Brad≈øhaw,</hi> the Referrees out of their love to Ju≈øtice, and to know the Truth; were plea≈øed to write to Sir <hi>James Harrington,</hi> Sir <hi>George Fleetwood,</hi> and <hi>Francis Allen</hi> E≈øquire, and ≈øent them Copies of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners Petition and Reference, ≈øub≈øcribed by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid Referrees, that ≈øo the≈øe Honourable Gentlemen, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the peru≈øal of your Petitioners Petition, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, thereupon would al≈øo be plea≈øed to certifie their knowledge of the Premi≈ø≈øes to the afore≈øaid Referrees, which they all of them were honourably plea≈øed to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie accordingly.</p>
               <p>For which Ju≈øtice of theirs I am bound to pray for every one of them, the like great Obligations your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner owes to the following Referrees, let the i≈ø≈øue of this Bu≈øine≈øs be what God plea≈øe, I have learned to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto his Providence, I am as clay in the Potters hands.</p>
               <p>And though I was very unwilling to print the≈øe Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates and the Referrees report to their late Highne≈ø≈øes Oliver and Richard, knowing the≈øe Honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen love to do the oppre≈ø≈øed right for con≈øcience ≈øake, without blowing a Trumpet not looking for thanks from men, that ≈øo God may reward them openly.</p>
               <p>Yet the pre≈øent po≈øture of my bu≈øine≈øs is ≈øuch, that to demon≈øtrate the many ≈øervices your Petitioner hath done this Common-wealth, your Honours ≈øhall ≈øee it certified under the hands of twenty four Honourable and Credible per≈øons, the Originalls I have ready to produce, I humbly crave pardon of the≈øe Honourable
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62073:47"/> Gentlemen for doing thereof without acquainting them therewith, it is both by the Lawes of God and this Nation, that out of the mouth of two VVitne≈ø≈øes every thing, ≈øhall bee e≈øtabli≈øhed, both for mens E≈øtates and Lifes by the Laws of this Land a Jury of twelve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons either quit or condemn all per≈øons of what degree ≈øoever.</p>
               <p>For your Honours Information, your Honours upon the peru≈øal of the≈øe Certificates would ≈øee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of faithfull and difficult ≈øervice, which your Petitioner at his great expence, charge, trouble, and lo≈ø≈øe of time, from the very houre your Petitioner was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged out of the Tower; <hi>viz.</hi> 1647 to the year 1651. the year before your Petitioner undertooke this great ≈øervice of ≈øtaying the Silver in the Ships <hi>Samp≈øon, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> and <hi>George.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In con≈øideration of which ≈øervice done as afore≈øaid, many of the Council of State and members of this Parliament, did promi≈øe your Petitioner the re≈øtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his E≈øtate, and they watched but for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to acquaint the Parliament therewith, that ≈øo his E≈øtate may bee re≈øtored unto him againe, all the≈øe ≈øervices and promi≈øes made by the Council in the year 1651. before ever this Silver was brought into the River, or the State had ≈øea≈øed on it.</p>
               <p>May it plea≈øe your Honours, in Decemb. 1652. before your Petitioner would undertake to make his di≈øcovery of the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> and <hi>Flemi≈øh</hi> fraudulent Claimes, to cozen the State of this Trea≈øure, and to be at the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62073:47"/> charge of pro≈øecuting the ≈øame in the Admiralty, your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner was nece≈ø≈øitated to come to a certain agreement about his e≈øtate with the Councel of State, and how he ≈øhould be paid for this ≈øervice, or el≈øe it had been a thing impo≈ø≈øible for your Petitioner to have undertaken this task, or to have gone through with it, in re≈øpect the Councel of State would not advance any money to your Petitioner, but would rather have let this ≈øilver go in the Admiraltie, as it had gone, had not your Petitioner in the very minute of time ≈øtayed it, as is atte≈øted under the hands of the Officers of the Mint, whereupon your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was forced to borrow great ≈øummes of money, to enable him to employ in≈øtruments to finde out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this fraud.</p>
               <p>Several Gentlemen lent your Petitioner ≈øeven hundred ≈øixty five pounds at intere≈øt, every penny ≈øpent in this ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the rea≈øon that both made your Petitioner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this difficult bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and made the≈øe Gentlemen lend your Petitioner this money, was upon the credit and faith of the Councel of States promi≈øe to your Petitioner, that if this ≈øilver was forfeited to the State, your Petitioner ≈øhould faithfullie be paid out of the ≈øame the ≈øumme of eleven thou≈øand pounds, in lieu of his e≈øtate, and this you will ≈øee clearly proved, and my friends knew me ≈øo well, that I would not to fail of your Petitioners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and for that your Petitioner was and is ready to prove to the Councel of State, his damage is far greater by his Seque≈øtration and Impri≈øonment then eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand pounds, the Councel of State did faithfully promi≈øe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62073:48"/> 1652. that over and above the paying of your Petitioner the ≈øumme of eleven thou≈øand pounds, for this ≈øervice of getting and ≈øtaying this ≈øilver, your Petitioner ≈øhould have an Honourable Reward and Memorial left to po≈øterity for the ≈øame, and it was upon this ≈øcore of getting my e≈øtate again off Seque≈øtration, or eleven thou≈øand pounds ≈øatisfaction, that I ever acted in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of the ≈øil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or in any other publick bu≈øine≈ø≈øe from the year 1647. to 1651. or ≈øince 1652. to this time, for had I not been a≈ø≈øured faithfully of my e≈øtate from the Councel of State, and relied on ju≈øt performance; or had I had the lea≈øt thought of ≈øuch u≈øage, and putting off from day to day with References and Reports now my work is done; when my bu≈øine≈øs, and what <hi>I</hi> de≈øerve is as well known (as the begger knows his di≈øh, or a man knows his right hand from his left.) I do humblie declare reallie to all the world, (I would have remembred that ≈øaying, a man may be over ju≈øt) or el≈øe I would have taken more con≈øideration then I have done of my own pre≈øervation, when I was offered ten thou≈øand pounds by the Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers for to have conniv'd and let the State be cozened of the ≈øilver in the Admiraltie, as they were at the time of many Dutch prize ≈øhips and goods. It could not enter into your Petitioners heart to ex≈øpect ≈øuch delaies by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and old Court tricks; had I thought of ≈øuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I had known a waie to paie my ≈øelf. Had your Petitioner ≈øpent his ≈øpirits, time and e≈øtate to have ≈øtudied di≈øturbance and malignancie, as much as hee hath ≈øtudied the honour, peace, profit and welfare of this Common-wealth,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62073:48"/> the ≈øilver in the ≈øhips <hi>Samp≈øon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George</hi> had never been coined in the Tower, being two hundred ≈øeventie eight thou≈øand pounds, but by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of ≈øome Merchants and others in the Admiraltie, had been cleared out of the Nation and ≈øent to the Dutch. Had your Petitioner <hi>December</hi> 16. 1652. at nine of the clock in the morning in the Court of Admiraltie been po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with the dumb ≈øpirit of malignancie, your Judges of the Admiraltie that verie daie and hour had cleared the afore≈øaid ≈øilver, the Admiral <hi>Van-Trump</hi> then lying on the Downes to have wa≈øted the ≈øilver to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which had not your Petitioner prevented by ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable applications to the Councel of State, might have prov'd of ≈øad con≈øequence, and have co≈øt many thou≈øand Engli≈øh mens lives, and God knowes what other dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to this Nation, ≈øuch an over-≈øight in the Court of Admiraltie might have brought upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62073:54"/> State, one order bearing date the 13. of</hi> Decemb. 1652. <hi>And al≈øo ≈øome other Orders of the then Council of State, whereby he the ≈øaid Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>was ordered to repair to the ≈øaid Court of Admiralty, and al≈øo to my ≈øelf as Advocate for the then Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And to look after and take care of tho≈øe ≈øaid bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, touching the ≈øaid Silver in the ≈øaid three Ships or to ≈øuch effect, and accordingly hee the ≈øaid Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>was therein very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and indu≈øtrious, and did by him≈øelfe and others imployed by him, and at his owne charge take great paines in following the ≈øaid bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and in ≈øearching after, and examination of the ≈øaid Ships, Papers, and Bookes, and writings, and other matters that were exhibited into the Regi≈øters of the Admiraltie, and in making his ob≈øervations thereupon, and collecting thereout what might make for the State, and looking after ≈øuch other evidences as hee could finde out, (wherein hee was noe way remi≈øs or negligent) and the ≈øaid Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>did openly owne the ≈øame bu≈øine≈øs in Court, and moved therein on behalf of the Parliament, and that earne≈øtly and with zeal, and made or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ≈øome Prote≈øt therein in the ≈øaid Court of Admiraltie.

                     <p>And truly I mu≈øt atte≈øt that both my ≈øelfe and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall others of the Parliament and Council, looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. Violet in this great undertaking of ≈øtaying the Silver mentioned in his Petition, in the Ships <hi>Samp≈øon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> was the great wheele of the worke that got the State this great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, for hee both di≈øcovered to the Council of State, the fraude of the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Amba≈ø≈øadour, and the fraudes

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62073:64"/>
               <p>I did offer in part of my ≈øatisfaction of eleven thou≈øand pounds, to except of the imployment of Regulating the manufacture of gold and ≈øilver thread, with the fees I formerly had received, and I humbly offered to accept of this office at the value of two thou≈øand pounds, this office being a part of my own E≈øtate, for which I paid formerly 1500l.</p>
               <p>And had I not bin di≈øturbed in the due execution, by ≈øome damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cheating Silkmen, and Wyer drawers and Refiners who make it their common trade to cozen the wearers of gold and ≈øilver lace, and have melted down within this twenty yeares of the Plate and heavy ≈øilver Coynes of the Nation to the value of a million of money, to the wi≈øpeakable lo≈ø≈øe of the Common-wealth, by wa≈øting of the blood and ≈øinews of this Nations money, which ought to bee kept in peoples pur≈øes to maintaine Trade and Commerce, and not to be put upon Womens Petticoats to be bur≈øt and wa≈øted away.</p>
               <p>For to induce his Highne≈ø≈øe <hi>Oliver</hi> to grant me the ≈øaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I annexed to my Petition and Papers a Report of the Committee of Parliament for Trade, Dated <hi>June</hi> 16. 1657. the original Report I have readie to produce to your Honours, which Report certifies that they have had it fully proved before them upon many dayes Examination, the great abu≈øes daily practi≈øed in the culling and melting down the currant ≈øilver coines of this Nation; for the expen≈øive making Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Lace, Wyre and Thread.

And that at this day there is no Rule nor Order for regulating the Work-ma≈øters, nor the Workers, but every one is 'e≈øt to cozentle Common-wealth, and they have certified it by what ≈øeveral wayes they do it; as will appear upon your Honours Peru≈øal of the Certificate of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for Trade.</p>
               <p>And the Committee for Trade finding this to be a great abu≈øe and cheat put on the Nation, have upon many dayes con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pre≈øented to that Parliament a Report of a Model and Way for the due Regulation of all the≈øe abu≈øes, and recommend in their Certificate your Petitioner for the execution of that ≈øervice, to be appointed the ≈øworn Officer, and to take the fees for doing that ≈øervice as formerly your Petitioner did, and that your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner for the future put in ≈øecurity in the Exchequer, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant all the≈øe Manufactures of Gold and Silver Lace, Wyre and Thread to be good ≈øilver, that is drawn, a≈ø≈øayed, marked or ≈øealed at the Office.</p>

               <p>Whereupon his Highne≈ø≈øe refers this Petition <hi>July</hi> 13. 1658. and all the afore≈øaid Reports, together with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Councel of Trade, for the regulating the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture

                  <hi>marriners and pa≈ø≈øengers which came that Voyage from</hi> Spain, <hi>and that the Pur≈øers books and many of the Bills of Lading were forged and altered at ≈øea after that they had heard certainly by ≈øome ≈øhips that the Dutch were at warrs with</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Parliaments Agent at</hi> Cades <hi>gave advice here to Mr</hi> Wil≈øon <hi>his kin≈øman, the day that the≈øe ≈øhips ≈øet ≈øaile from</hi> Cades, <hi>and though they gave out there that they were to go for</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>yet their de≈øigned Port was</hi> Am≈øterdam, <hi>they being loaden for the greate≈øt part upon the account of the Dutch, and the ≈øame was confe≈øt in the Admiraltie by many of the Pa≈øsengers and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Decemb. 14. 1652. <hi>The Spani≈øh Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> Don A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon≈øo de Cardenas, <hi>Emba≈ø≈øador extraordinary for the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>came in per≈øon to the Parliament, and made an Oration in the Hou≈øe, claiming all this ≈øilver in the≈øe three ≈øhips to belong to his Ma≈øter and for his Ma≈øters ≈øubjects account; which Speech hee al≈øo at the ≈øame time pre≈øented to the Parliament in writing both in Spani≈øh and Engli≈øh, together with two bundles of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers touching this ≈øilver, which hee referred to the con≈øideration of the Hou≈øe: And for ≈øeveral daies hee made his appearance at the Council of State, and put in the like claimes for this ≈øilver, hee ingaging his Honour that no part of it did belong to the Dutch, as will appear by the proceedings and the records of the Council of State, and Mr</hi> Stenier <hi>was bayled, and his bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe never called on to this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While the≈øe bu≈øine≈ø≈øes were tran≈øacted at the Parliament, Councel of State, and Admiraltie, I made the Lord</hi> Brad≈øhaw <hi>and many of the Council of State acquainted with the whole pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and fraud that was intended to be put on them by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62073:71"/> parties, and that if they had not a ≈øpecial care, the Judges in the Admiraltie would di≈øcharge this ≈øilver, and the Dutch had rather it ≈øhould be in the bottom of the ≈øea than wee ≈øhould have it. Upon this Information the Council of State commanded mee to attend carefully the motions of the Court of Admiraltie and the Merchants touching this Silver, and from time to time to give the Council an account what was done in the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon,</hi> December 15. 1652. <hi>I made the Council ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, That the Judges of the Admiraltie had appointed to bring the≈øe ≈øhips,</hi> Samp≈øon, Salvador <hi>and</hi> George, <hi>their ≈øil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and lading to a judgment the next day, being</hi> Decemb. 16. <hi>in the Admiraltie; And that I did believe the Judges would cleare the ≈øhips, the Lord</hi> Brad≈øhaw <hi>and ≈øome others of the Council askt mee what rea≈øon I had to ≈øay ≈øo or to ≈øu≈øpect ≈øo: Whereupon I told them, the Commi≈øsioners of Dutch prize Goods had given me a warrant to go aboard the≈øe Dutch prize ≈øhips when I pleas'd, and to imploie whom I thought good to get acquaintance with the ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aboard the≈øe ≈øhips. And I had certain intelligence, that</hi> Otho George, <hi>Captain of the</hi> Samp≈øon, <hi>had commanded all his men to be in readine≈ø≈øe and had taken in fre≈øh victualling and biskets, and that in a few daies they ≈øhould be at</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that</hi> Van Tromp <hi>would do them no hurt though hee were on the Downes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon this di≈øcovery, many of the Council of State did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the great dammage and danger the Nation was in if this great trea≈øure ≈øhould fall into the hands; of the Dutch, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much debate I was commanded by the Council to attend in the Court of Admiraltie,</hi> Decemb. 16. <hi>all the while the Court ≈øate, and if the Judges did go about to clear the ≈øilver, then I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62073:72"/> ≈øhould make my Prote≈øt again≈øt their proceedings, till my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes were examined that ≈øhould di≈øcover the fraud: And the Councel likewi≈øe charged mee, That if the Judges askt mee by what authoritie I made my Prote≈øt, I ≈øhould deny I had any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Councel of State but I ≈øhould do it upon my owne peril and account, if I were certain I could di≈øprove the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh Amba≈ø≈øador, and if I did prove that there was ≈øilver aboard the≈øe ≈øhips belonging to the Dutch, out of the first hundred thou≈øand pounds that was coined of this ≈øilver, I ≈øhould be paid eleven thou≈øand pounds, being in lieu of my e≈øtate that I had for many yeares petitioned for, whereupon I told the Council the e≈øtate the Parliament took from me, endamaged me above ≈øixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand pounds, many of the Councel replying (Perform you what you have undertaken, which we believe you are never able to do) and you ≈øhall have an honourable reward for this ≈øervice, over and above eleven thou≈øand pounds which you claim for your e≈øtate. I have done this ≈øervice, and two hundred ≈øeventy eight thou≈øand pounds the State hath had, and employed it for the de≈øence of the Common-wealth, in paying the Army and Navy, as will appear by the Accounts of Coll.</hi> Bark≈øtead; <hi>yet to this day the Council of State hath not performed their faithful Promi≈øe to me, to pay me eleven thou≈øand pounds, and to give me an honourable reward over and above for this ≈øervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very remarkable, that there was a de≈øigne laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt ≈øome of Mr <hi>Steniers</hi> great ones to cozen the State of this Trea≈øure; and would I have been Knave, I might have been one of his great ones, and have taken ten thou≈øand pounds to let the ≈øilver go, as in this Book is cortifiedby many honourable per≈øons might have had.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62073:72"/>
               <p>And that to ≈øome in the Admiralty, my appearing in that Court to ≈øtay this ≈øilver was mo≈øt di≈øta≈øtfull and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpected, and ≈øpoiled ≈øome peoples markets both in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie and other places too; for ≈øome of the Judges in the Admiralty, <hi>(Exton</hi> and <hi>Stevens) Decem.</hi> 16. 1652. were ≈øo farre from giving mee thanks for my di≈øcovery, and for making my Prote≈øt in the behalf of the State to ≈øave this ≈øilver (which had not their intere≈øt and profit layen another way they ought to have done) but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwi≈øe openly in the Court before many hundreds of merchants have reviled mee and would of di≈øcharged this ≈øilver.</p>
               <p>And had I not received a command from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State the day before to act in that manner, to be ≈øure to keep the Judges from di≈øcharging the ≈øilver, let the Judges ≈øay what they plea≈øed, the Iudges would that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have di≈øcharged the ≈øilver, and con≈øulted together to commit mee; they di≈øputed the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe ≈øo lowd, that I and many others heard it: And the Iudges bid <hi>Wyeen</hi> the then Regi≈øter of the Admiralty call on the ≈øhips <hi>Samp≈øon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> not minding what I ≈øaid: this can be proved by many merchants, and is fully certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Officers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I told Mr <hi>Wyeen</hi> the Regi≈øter, that if he and the Iudges did di≈øcharge the ≈øilver in the≈øe ≈øhips, and did not forbear their ≈øentence till my Witne≈ø≈øes were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I would make it the deare≈øt daies work they ever did in their lives or to that effect. And I undertook before the Iudges in the Admiralty upon the peril of my life to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62073:73"/> the <hi>Sani≈øh</hi> Amba≈ø≈øador and <hi>Flemmi≈øh</hi> Claimes to this ≈øilver. Whereupon Mon≈øieur <hi>Motett</hi> (the Spani≈øh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors Secretary) hearing mee ≈øay ≈øo to the Iudges, was in a very great rage, and ≈øo were all the re≈øt of the Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I told the Iudges, that if they would clear the ≈øilver, notwith≈øtanding my Prote≈øt, before my witne≈ø≈øes were examined, it was mo≈øt apparent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was betrayed, and bribes given and taken by ≈øome great ones to cozen the Common-wealth of this ≈øilver, but it ≈øhould not be in their power to do it, for I would prevent them.</p>
               <p>And that if the Iudges did proceed to di≈øcharge this ≈øilver, and that this ≈øilver come into the hands of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Iudges lives and e≈øtates could not make the Common-wealth ≈øatisfaction; for that <hi>Van Tromp</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> General was then on the Downer, and an ha≈øtie Iudgment, before the truth of this plot was di≈øcovered, would put this ≈øilver into the <hi>Dutch</hi> mens power, which might be of ≈øad con≈øequence to this Nation, and may co≈øt many thou≈øand <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> men their lives. VVhereupon all the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> and <hi>Flemmi≈øh</hi> Claimers were in a great rage, heat and di≈øcontent.</p>
               <p>Two of the Iudges <hi>(Exton</hi> and <hi>Stevens)</hi> told mee I had undone my ≈øelfe for ever, in making my Prote≈øt again≈øt the di≈øcharge of the ≈øilver, and by my other actions and words that day in the Admiralty; and ≈øo the Iudges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded mee to attend the Council of State that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: And ≈øo the Court broke up, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62073:73"/> 
                  <hi>Flemmings</hi> cur≈øing mee bitterly, and I ex≈øpected every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute to be murdered by them.</p>
               <p>The Iudges of the Admiralty prophe≈øied truer then <hi>Lilly</hi> hitherto; for they told mee the ≈øtaying of this ≈øilver would undo mee: for if the Council of State do not pay mee the eleven thou≈øand pounds they promi≈øed mee, I have by my faithfulne≈øs, hone≈øty and integrity to my Countrey in the prote≈øting again≈øt the di≈øcharge of this ≈øilver in the Admiralty, and by my con≈øtant, chargeable and dangerous pro≈øecution thereof, in getting the State two hundred ≈øeventy eight thou≈øand pound, in refu≈øing the Claimers money, when they offered mee ten thou≈øand pounds to be ≈øilent and let the State be cozened of the ≈øil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: VVould I have been a knave I might have been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among Mr <hi>Stenieers</hi> great ones, but my faithfulne≈øs to my Countrey in this particular ≈øervice (if the State be not ju≈øt to mee in their promi≈øe) will undo mee for ever.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have formerly delivered a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of ≈øome of your names, and the ≈øummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I borrowed of you to to enable me to do this great ≈øervice, all my owne E≈øtate being under a ≈øeque≈øtration, unto the Commi≈ø≈øioners that were appointed to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>

               <p>I ≈øhall humblie leave it to the con≈øideration of the Parliament, Councel of State, and all true Engli≈øhmen that are Lovers of their Countrey, and re≈øpect the credit of the Nation, when they ≈øhall reade what I have done in this ≈øervice, ≈øo clearly proved.</p>

               <p>

               <p>I have, and can produce to the Parliament a Certificate of the Committee of Trade dated the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1657. upon many days examination of all the≈øe abu≈øes, <hi>I</hi> have it

               <p>I will demon≈øtrate this Nation had better have given at this day one hundred thou≈øand pounds to me to have kept up this Office to a due Regulation, then have put down my Office, by the doing thereof they have had a million of money le≈øs in the ≈øtock of the Nation then they ≈øhould have had, had my Office continued, if the Parliament plea≈øe to impower me to Regulate this manufacture, and to receive the fees I took formerly, I humbly will accept of it for two thou≈øand pounds ≈øo I may have it for two li≈øes, in part of payment of the eleven thou≈øand pounds which the State owes me.</p>

               <p>I pray read and con≈øider what I have ≈øaid concerning this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe in this book, Fol 11. 12. 13 14. if the State im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me here in the Mint, I will remove all the≈øe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, and ≈øet the Mint a working, and this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if I have it for my life, I will humbly accept of it at the value of two thou≈øand pounds, in part of payment of my ≈øatisfaction of eleven thou≈øand pounds, and by my indu≈øtry and care will increa≈øe the States Stock every year ≈øome hundred of thou≈øand of pounds of Silver, which now comes in, and is ≈øtollen out.</p>
               <p>I would never undertake to do this diffiult bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, were <hi>I</hi> not a≈ø≈øured there is none in the Nation can do it but my ≈øelf, and till the State imploy me, this work will never be done effectually.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62073:81"/>
               <p>Three of you Gentlemen are great mints men and Gold ≈ømiths, and know the difficultie of this undertaking, and I dare affirme before you, none of you will trouble your ≈øelves to finde out the bottom of the≈øe difficult waies that mu≈øt be u≈øed to do this ≈øervice, not for ten times the profit I ≈øhall receive by this Emploiment.</p>
               <p>Therefore I humbly de≈øire to have an act to injoy the place of Ma≈øter-worker and Melter for my life, provided I do this ≈øervice within three moneths after my grant, this mi≈øcheif is come to a gangrene, and the Council of State mu≈øt make ≈øharp and ≈øtrict Orders in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, or el≈øe this mi≈øcheif cannot be remedied, a great deal of care mu≈øt be u≈øed to put the≈øe Laws in Execution, el≈øe there wil be a perpetual con≈øumption of the Stock of the Nation in the Silver coines, as it is come already on the Gold coines, you ≈øhall not receive in a thou≈øand pounds one twenty-≈øhillings-peece in Gold, and in few years there wil be the like defect in the Silver, not ≈øo much as will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commerce, and Trade, pay Rents and Taxes, nor to go to Market.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt Sluce-gate that mu≈øt be ≈øtopped, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the melting of gold and Silver currant coins of the Nation, for gold and ≈øilver thread it is true there is a Law again≈øt it, but who looks after the Execution, Execution is that that gives life to the Law.</p>
               <p>The like cour≈øe mu≈øt be taken again≈øt the Tran≈øporting gold &amp; ≈øilver out of the Nation, it is true old Laws forbid it, but who makes it their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe to di≈øcover the offenders</p>
               <p>Had the Act pa≈ø≈øed in the Hou≈øe which I pro≈øecuted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62073:82"/> again≈øt Tran≈øporting Gold and Silver, and <hi>I</hi> impowered and imployed as <hi>I</hi> humbly propounded ten years ago, this Nation had had at this day millions of Silver which is now Tran≈øported, to the great damage of the Nation.</p>
               <p>This Act hath bin twice read in the Hou≈øe, ten times Committed, Referred to the Committee of the Navies, Officers of the Mint, Officers of the Cu≈øtomes, all their Reports and Certificates certifie that if the Parliament will not pa≈ø≈øe this Act, and appoint able skilfull per≈øons to make it their bu≈øine≈ø≈øe to hinder the Tran≈øporting Gold and Silver, the ≈øtock of Gold and Silver in the Nation would be all Tran≈øported, and this Nation expo≈øed to very great inconveniences by not preventing it, who can or could ≈øay more then the≈øe Certificates ≈øay.</p>
               <p>If the Parliament plea≈øe to pa≈ø≈øe this Act, I will ≈øpend my time and paines, and in that ≈øervice, take the≈øe Tran≈øporters in the nick of their action, and confi≈øcate the monies, had <hi>I</hi> Warrants and did ≈øet my ≈øpringes I would catch the≈øe Woodcocks, my experience would be of great advantage, for an old Dear ≈øtealer is the be≈øt keeper of the Park, and it is not unknown to ≈øome of you that almo≈øt thirty yeares ago <hi>I</hi> was que≈øtioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Tran≈øporting Gold and Silver, I di≈øcovered a ne≈øt of Tran≈øporters of Gold, and the King ingaged me to do that ≈øervice, I cau≈øed them to be fined twenty foure thou≈øand one hundred pounds, in the year 1635. in the Starr Chamber, as appears by the Records, and made Alderman <hi>Gibbs,</hi> and Sir John <hi>Wolla≈øton,</hi> glad to Petition and pay well to the late King for their Pardons, for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62073:82"/> abu≈øes done in their Trades, and this was the true ground of <hi>Gibbes,</hi> and <hi>Wolla≈øtones</hi> revenge again≈øt me.</p>
               <p>When in the yeer 1643. they maliciou≈øly and Knavi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged honourable Gentlemen to pre≈øent me to the Parliament for a malignant, and to ≈øend me to the Tower, and ≈øeque≈øter my E≈øtate, to my damage at this day twenty thou≈øand pounds, only to work their malicious ends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, when at that time they had Trappaned me, to catch me as a man catcheth a Partridg with their Lowbel, Mr. <hi>Theophilus Rily</hi> who decoyed me into this ≈ønare to undertake to bring up from <hi>Oxford</hi> the Letter from the Late King Charles, mentioned in this Book, Fol. 33.</p>
               <p>And then to aggravat it again≈øt me with that Violence to ≈øome honourable members of Parliament, that it had like to co≈øt me my life, and I ≈øuffered almo≈øt four years impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonment in the Tower, and had my e≈øtate ≈øeque≈øtred to my damage of twenty thou≈øand pounds as appeares in this Book, Fol. 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Petitioned the late</hi> Protector <hi>Richard for to give me and ≈øome others I nominated in tru≈øt for my u≈øe, the grant of making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon farthing, as appeares in this booke Fol. 118. 119. 120. 121. 122. the late</hi> Protector <hi>accordingly gives me</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the grant of the ≈øame for 31. years in part of my reward for this ≈øervice of ≈øtaying the Silver, and orders the Solicitor Generall to attend the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Approbation, who are de≈øired to ordain and appoint ≈øuch Rules, Prohibitions, and Penalties, for the effectuall, and better management of this ≈øervice, the preventing of all former abu≈øes, and re≈øtraining the importation and Counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any the ≈øaid farthings from the parts beyond Sea, as they

               <p>
                  <hi>I ≈øhall humbly de≈øire the Parliament, to give me the grant for the ≈øole making of a Publique farthing for 31. yeares of the value and weight afore≈øaid, and I ≈øhall humbly and thankfully accept of this imployment as the value of five thou≈øand pounds towards my debt of eleven thou≈øand pounds, and if the Parliament plea≈øe to have a farthing made lighter, yet as heavy againe as the common farthings, I ≈øhall make a common farthing to go currant in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and I will pay unto the maimed Solders five ≈øhillings upon every two and twenty ≈øhillings that is uttered in the Office, and accompt, truely upon Oath, this will be a great revenew to the maimedSolders, and I will be bound to accompt monthly to the Trea≈øurers of the maimed Solders, which will be about three hundred pounds a moneth for ≈øome years.</hi>
