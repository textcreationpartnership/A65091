            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a curious Art to make a Watch, and he muſt be a skilful Artiſt, that exactly ſets a broken Bone, God for the ſins of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath ſeveral times in this Age, took the Clock of this Common-wealth in pieces, and many of the pins and wheels have bin and are miſplaced. It now requires great skill, to place and ſet every thing in its due order.</p>
            <p>Your Honours have a great work to do, God hath broken us in pieces, and divided our Councels, and none can unite us, but he that hath wounded us, he only muſt cure us, and bleſs and ſanctifie all lawful means, or
<pb facs="tcp:62073:3"/> elſe our disjoynted bones will never be truly knit, or exactly ſet.</p>
            <p>For this end hath God apointed a ſelect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honourable perſons, of which number your Honours are Members, whoſe heart God hath fixed for this great Work, to revive the ſtones out of the heap of rubbiſh, and to build the Walls of our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though the <hi>Sanballats, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> be worth, and conſpire altogether to fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to hinder this VVork.</p>
            <p>Right Honourable, if you will finiſh this good VVork you have begun, you muſt do as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, keep good watch day and night, becauſe of your enemies, leſt your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſerve you, as they ſerved <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> for they ſay you ſhall not know nor ſee till we come in the midſt amongſt them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe, if this be not prevented, this Parliament will have a fatal end.</p>
            <p>Preſidents in Courts of Juſtice is a great Guide to all juſt Judges, eſpecially when they have been made by the Grave and Learned,
<pb facs="tcp:62073:3"/> and are recorded in the Sacred Bible, the chiefeſt Book that every good Stateſman walks by; ſuch Stateſmen that walks by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavels</hi> rules, the wicked <hi>Maximes</hi> of theſe troubleſom times, they do as <hi>Saul</hi> did when he left God, and went to the VVitch of <hi>Endor,</hi> he pretended to go to ſpeak with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and met with the devil, ſo theſe times have produced many a Faſt, the pretence hath bin to ſeek God and Peace, when the true end hath bin to get to be the Head of a Party and Faction, to make diviſion, and to get the Peoples money: The People are now very well acquainted with ſuch canting, and as we know after a flaſh of lightning, there comes a clap of thunder, ſo hath it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times fallen out, after Faſts hath followed an erecting of an High Court of Juſtice, or one remarkable oppreſſion or other.</p>
            <p>I humbly preſent you here in this Epiſtle, with a good Preſident made by a great Stateſman <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ſuch a one as God hath recorded was a Saviour of his Countrey, a Builder up of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the like caſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:62073:4"/> in the like ſtraits as it is now, or ſuddenly without Gods infinite mercy will be vvith us, he took this courſe. In the firſt place, he ſought God, and prayed before the God of Heaven, and did not make a mock-Faſt; then he uſed the means, he fell to his VVork, and built up the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and did not only build, but he built wiſely and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly, and had there bin a <hi>Sanballat</hi> found amongſt them, the people would have ſtoned him.</p>
            <p>On the lovver places behind the vvall, and on the higher places, he ſet the people after their families, vvith their ſvvords, their ſpears and their bovves; and vvhen he had ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a poſture of defence, he made the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be his Guard, and delivered an Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Rulers and People, ſaying, <hi>Be not afraid of your enemies, remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your ſonnes and your daughters, your wives and your houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall humbly deſire your Honours to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, vvhat vvas the effect of this orderly
<pb facs="tcp:62073:4"/> and good poſture. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not their work careleſſely and by halfes, and ſpent their precious time in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe queſtions, but did all things upon ſound advice. For when great things are quietly without Faction diſputed, and the Reſult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; then to uſe expedition and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is juſt policie.</p>
            <p>But all haſty and unadviſed attempts at long running brings the Common-wealth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great danger, and the Actors generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt and miſery, many men in their deſignes thinking to catch a great Fiſh, but after long angling bring up a Frog; this daily experience hath ſhewed, and I can experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally ſay it to be true.</p>
            <p>For thoſe men that read <hi>Machiavel,</hi> and make it their Rule to walk by, in ſtead of the Bible, becauſe they are in great places, to practice Iniquity by a Law, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did for <hi>Naboths</hi> Viniard, who did not only cheat him of his Land and Inheritance, but robbed him of his Life, and to ſeem holy called a Faſt, the effect of that godly Faſt was to ſet two
<pb facs="tcp:62073:5"/> mens ſonns of <hi>Belial,</hi> to beare falſe witneſſe that <hi>Naboth</hi> had Bſaſphemed God and the King, ſending a warrant for the Execution of innocent <hi>Naboth</hi> before ever they tryed him, that he ſhould be ſton'd to death right or wrong, what a ſad End the Authors of this murder and robbery come to is well known, how many great and Noble Perſons of the eminenteſt for quality in this Nation, have bin Trappaned and perjured out of their Lifes, Lands and Eſtates, and ſome of the witneſſes upon their Death beds with horrour of Conſcience, and great Remorſe have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the perjury that they were ſuborned by others, to the great ſcandal of the Juſtice of the Nation by ſuch waies to get mens Eſtates.</p>
            <p>This is moſt apparent God is comming to viſit for theſe things, and when man cannot bring the Delinquents to Juſtice, he cauſeth the guilty Perſons one to puniſh another, till by the dividing and ſubdividing they are ſo weak, that as the flood cam upon the old world and deſtroyed mankinde, ſo by theſe diviſions
<pb facs="tcp:62073:5"/> the ſtrength of the Nation is disjoynted. Every man upon and againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, making a paſſage and way for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy to come and ſwallovv the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent with the guilty, if God be not mercifull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> divided the Red-Sea, and the Children of Iſrael paſſed over on dry Land, God hath by nature made a Sea betvveen us and our Neighbours, he hath hedged us in, and made a vvall of ſeperation between us and Popery, but our ſins at this day are pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down this wall, the wilde Bore of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is come in amongſt us, the Devil and the Jeſuites have plaid their parts in this Nation, to the ruining of many Body and Soul, and to the admiration of Chriſtendom, the Jewes Crucified Chriſt thinking to gratifie <hi>Caeſar, Caeſar</hi> a few years after paid them to purpoſe for Crucifying him.</p>

               <hi>May it pleaſe your Honours, The ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and Fonts for chriſtning of children at the beginning of theſe Troubles were plucked down; and now comes Pulpits to be beaten in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and frequent tumults in ſeveral Churches
<pb facs="tcp:62073:6"/> within the city of</hi> London, <hi>as lately at</hi> Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>pariſh hath bin done, which is a corner of the city, where many poor live, and are fit for any Inſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When I ſee children with a candle amongſt powder or chips, I feare the burning of the houſe, or a blow with powder; when wee ſee the buds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, the ſpring is near: theſe are as certaine ſignes of a miſchief; as the plague-tokens are to a man that hath the Plague, the beſt ſymptomes are a purple fever; a ſhaking, an earth-quake, if not a diſſolution. The pride and vanity of ſome Lecturers and Miniſters, who in the Nation having ſtudyed points of diſſention and diviſion, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of the Goſpel of Chriſt preach themſelves, (too much plenty have made them wanton.)</hi>

            <p>What a diveliſh State trick vvas put upon the late Protector <hi>Oliver,</hi> and his Secretary Mr. <hi>Thurloe,</hi> by Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons Jeſuitically inclined, in ſetting the Protector on that fatal buſineſſe of <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> without ever adviſing and conſulting with many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Planters, who had for many years lived in thoſe parts, and had they had the honour to have been conſulted with, they could have told them that thoſe fiery Regions was not for the conſtitution of our bodies.</p>

            <p>May it pleaſe your Honours, I hope your Honours will pardon theſe ſad and neceſſarie truths, proceeding from a loyal heart. I have formerly ventured my life many times to get the Common-wealth two hundred ſeventie eight thouſand pounds in money, I now ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my ſelf in theſe dangerous times to ſpeak

               </p>
               <p>Upon Examination of this Buſineſſe at the Councel of State, the Councel within few dayes after, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and engaged your Petitioner in this ſervice, and your Petitioner did faithfully promiſe the Councel his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt endeavours, to diſcover this fraud, and at his own charge to proſecute this Buſineſſe in the Court of Admſraltie. The Judges of the Court of Admiraltie did appoint the 16. day of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1652. to give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for clearing theſe ſhips and ſilver, being to the value of about three hundred thouſand pounds in ſilver, as appears by the Certificate of the Officers of the Mint; Whereupon your Petitioner came into the Court of Admiralty, the very day and houre the Judges were clearing the ſaid ſilver, and at his own peril made his Proteſt in the Admiraltie againſt the Judges of that Court, and againſt all further Proceedings of theirs, to diſcharge this Silver in the aforeſaid ſhips, till your Petitioners Witneſſes were examined, and ſhewed the Judges many Reaſons, being for the advantage and ſafety of the Common-wealth, for reſpiting for ſome dayes their Judgment.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Court of Admiralty adjourned till the next day; and the Judges being very angry with your Petitioner for making the aforeſaid Proteſt, and for what your Petitioner had ſaid to the Judges in open Court, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62073:11"/> Judges thereupon command your Petitioner to attend the Council of State that very day in the afternoon, being 16 of <hi>December</hi> 1652. the Petitioner to anſwer before them for his mildemeanor (ſo the Iudges were pleaſed to call it) that morning in the Court of Admiralty.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner did accordingly attend the Council of State that day, 16 <hi>Dec.</hi> in the afternoon, and upon full examination of the Buſineſs before them, the Council ſtayed the ſilver, and blamed the Judges for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of your Petitioner, and your Petitioner had thanks from the Council for what hee had done in his timely and ſeaſonable ſtaying this ſilver, and commanded to uſe what expedition hee could in proving that great quantities of the ſilver then aboard theſe ſhips appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Thereupon your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner undertook to the Council of State to diſprove the Spaniſh and Flemiſh clamors, and the Spaniſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors pretences to all this ſilver in the aforeſaid ſhips. And this diſcovery your Petitioner undertook to make to the Council of State at his own charge.</p>
               <p>The Council of State upon the conſiderations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and to incourage your Petitioner to proceed, they did faithfully promiſe your Petitioner for this his ſervice and diſcovery, that your Petitioner ſhould be paid the ſum of eleven thouſand pounds out of the ſilver that ſhould be taken out of theſe ſhips, and converted to the uſe of the Common-wealth, this ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds, being the value of your Petitioners Eſtate, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62073:12"/> the Parliament 1643. upon mis-information againſt your Petitioner had ſequeſtred.</p>
               <p>And the Council of State declared unto your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, That if your Petitioner ſhould fail to make good his undertaking in diſproving the Spaniſh and Flemiſh Claims to all this ſilver, then aboard the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> that the undertaking would undo your Petitioner; for upon your Petitioners failing to make good proof of what he had undertaken, the Councel of State would report your Petitioner to the Parliament to be an Incendiary, therefore it highly concerned your Petitioner to be well aſſured of what he had undertaken, and alſo to be juſtly dealt withal when he had done this ſervice.</p>
               <p>Upon the aſſurance of the Councel of State upon the aforeſaid termes, your Petitioner engaged and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this great, difficult, and dangerous ſervice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Petitioner employed above ten ſeveral perſons, for about two years, and laid out of Purſe, beſides all his time and hazard, the ſumme of above ſeven hundred ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five pounds, which he payes intereſt for at this very day, as is depoſed by ſeveral Witneſſes whom your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners employed in this ſervice, and this is atteſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of ſeveral Honourable Perſons, to the late Lord Protector <hi>Oliver.</hi>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Honours, beſides this ſervice your Petitioner did for the Common-wealth, he diſcovered to the Councel of State, in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1651. That from <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62073:12"/> to <hi>December</hi> 20. 1652. the Admiralty had diſcharged fifty eight ſhips, all loaden with rich merchandize, I printed the ſeveral daies of the moneth they were cleared out of the Court of Admiralty, the names of the ſhips, and the Maſter of the ſhips names, and the parties to whom theſe ſhips and merchandize was delivered at <hi>London;</hi> and that many of theſe ſhips after their diſcharge from hence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded their merchandize at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for the account of the Dutch, to the value of many hundred thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>Upon examination of this Buſineſs, the Council of State had certain intelligence from beyond ſea that this information was true, and theſe Letters were remaining in Captain <hi>Biſheps</hi> hands who can teſtifie the truth. Whereupon your Petitioner humbly preſented to the Council of State in writing ſeveral waies for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this abuſe for the future, and the Judges in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie was removed, and other Iudges put in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with particular inſtructions for the prevention of the former frauds put on the Nation.</p>
               <p>By which diſcovery made by your Petitioner, the Common-wealth got many ſcore prizes, which were condemned as Dutch prizes, when they could not bring atteſtations from <hi>Hamborough</hi> under the Parliament Agents hands, <hi>viz</hi> Mr <hi>Bradſhaws,</hi> that they really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonged to <hi>Hamborough.</hi> The value of the Ships and goods by your Petitioners means diſcovered was amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeveral ſcore of thouſand pounds, beſides all the ſilver your Petitioner ſtayed, which the Dutch had cozen.

It was nothing for ordinary Proctors in the Admiralty to get foure of five thouſand pounds a yeare, by cozening the State in their prizes, till your Petitioner by his diſcovery to the Councel of State, ſpoiled their Trade for a great part of it. This diſcovery got your Petitioner the envy of many hundred Merchants, and others in the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>There was not a motion, nor any Proceedings in the Court of Admiralty, for about three yeares, touching the Silver Ships <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> their ſilver and lading, but every day your Petitioner was required to give his attendance therein, at the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and forced to employ at his own charge many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and your Petitioner was required by Doctor <hi>Walker,</hi> at his own charge to employ many perſons to breviate and have inſpection into all the Records, Acts, Bills of lading, Pleas, Extracts, Allegations, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, Witneſſes, Depoſitions in the Silver buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as will appear under the hands of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons employed and paid by your Petitioner for that ſervice.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner did ſeveral times move the Councel of State, in <hi>December, January, February, March</hi> 1652.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62073:13"/> to unload the ſilver out of the ſhips, to avoid the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezeling thereof, there being above an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſtollen out of theſe ſhips, while the ſilver was in the River; there are bills of lading in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, for ſilver that was never delivered into the Tower, to the value of above a hundred thouſand pounds in ſilver, which bills appertain to theſe ſhips, <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George.</hi>

               <p>Your Petitioner preſented to the Councel of State, in 1652. 1653. ſeveral frauds and abuſes put upon the Common-wealth, in the Sale of their Prizes, Ships, and Merchandize, by the indirect meanes of ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers they intruſted to ſell the ſame, ſometimes the State hath been cheated fourty in the hundred, to the value of many ſcore of thouſand pounds in this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner finding theſe papers that made this Diſcovery, which he delivered to Col. <hi>Joanes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thurloe,</hi> (by ſome bribing means) in the Cuſtodie of ſome of the parties complained of; and that nothing was done to reform theſe abuſes, but this buſineſs was ſtiffed. (And by your Petitioners diſcovery of the abuſes for the ſervice of the State, he had contracted the envie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny guilty perſons) Thereupon to ſhew to the world, what I had delivered in private to the aforeſaid perſons was true, and that I would juſtifie what I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of privately, I printed the ſeveral frauds and cheats put upon the Nation by ſome of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for prize Goods, and ſome of their Officers and Agents, and demonſtrated ſeveral wayes for the State to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62073:14"/> finde it out, which was offered to be proved to be true, by Mr. <hi>John Day,</hi> and ſeveral others at that time, but the fate of the Common-wealth in thoſe dayes was to be cozened, that makes the debts of the publick now at this time ſo great, and the Publicans of the time ſo rich.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner by order of Parliament, as appears by your Records of the Houſe, for ſeveral yeares was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to follow and ſolicite the getting of an Act to paſſe againſt tranſporting Gold and Silver. And your Petitioner made ſeveral overtures both for puniſhing and diſcovery of the offenders that had tranſported Gold and Silver, and melted down the ſilver coyn of the Nation; by whoſe fines many ſcore of thouſand pounds would have juſtly come to the State.</p>
               <p>But the guilty perſons were then ſo powerfull in the Councills of the Parliament, that though the Parliament made ſeveral Committees of the Houſe and Council of State, for the perfecting the Act and for diſcovery of the offenders, and referred the matter thereof to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Commiſsioners of the Navy, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Mint, and Farmers of the Cuſtomes, who all of them have certified the Parliament of the great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and dammage the Common-wealth ſuffered by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral evil-diſpoſed perſons, who for private lucre and gain daily tranſported the Gold and Silver of the Nation, to the unſpeakable damage of the Common-wealth. This Bill being twice read in the Houſe, and ſeveral times committed, yet by the power of ſome guilty Merchants, this good Act was ſtopt, ſmothered and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62073:14"/> and never finiſht, though your Petitioner attended many yeares at his great expence and charges to have this good Act paſt, (And now at this day it is apparent to all people,) that you cannot receive in the payment of a thouſand pounds twenty ſhillings in Gold, no Gold being ſtirring in the Nation, but in the hands of Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Rooks, and Goldſmiths, they ſelling a twenty ſhillings piece in Gold for two ſhillings in the pound, more then the price current by Proclamation, which is againſt the Statute of the fifth and ſixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. And to give your Honours an information of the preſent ſtock of Silver moneys, now current in this Nation, there is very little left but light and clipt money, the weightie ſilver money, being culled, melted down, and tranſported, by divers Goldſmiths and others, for private lucre and gain, to the unſpeakable damage of the Common-wealth, eſpecially at this time, now we have War with <hi>Spain.</hi> This your Petitioner hath often complained of to this Parliament, and hath humbly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them a remedy, but as yet nothing hath been done by them to prevent this miſchief.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That his Highneſſe <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all the Premiſſes, would be pleaſed preſently to pay the Petitioner <hi>Tho.

This Report is at large ſigned and certified to his late Highneſs, <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector, the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1658. by Col. <hi>Barkſtead</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, Mr. Alderman <hi>Vyner, Gabriel Beck, John Limbery, Edward Denly, Henry Middleton, Maurice Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Treaſurer of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, <hi>Iſaac Doriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws,</hi> as appears by the original Certificate.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner petitioned the late Lord Protector <hi>Oliver</hi> 29. <hi>July</hi> 1658. and annexed the aforenamed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Referrees, and petitioned to be paid the ſum of eleven thouſand pound.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62073:20"/> ſo that the Petitioner may have and receive ſatisfaction according to Juſtice and Equity for this ſervice 29. <hi>July</hi> 1658. but his death ſhortly following, nothing as yet hath been done for your Petitioners ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner thereupon in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1658. petitioned the late Lord Protector <hi>Richard</hi> for his ſatisfaction, and annexed the aforeſaid Reports and Petitions (upon his Highneſſe peruſal of the ſame) he was pleaſed to referre the ſame unto the conſideration of <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his Requeſts, and <hi>Gabriel Beck</hi> Eſquires, Solicitor to the late Councel of State; They after many dayes meeting concerning this buſineſſe, have certified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as Col. <hi>Barkſtead,</hi> and the former Referrees have done, <hi>viz.</hi> for the due paying your Petitioner the ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds, and that they hold the Petitioner to be a perſon very fit and uſeful to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in removing the obſtructions of the Mint, and that the Petitioner be employed for regulating the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of gold and ſilver Wyre and Lace, which Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates are here to be produced to your Honours, ſigned by <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Beck</hi> Eſquires, 18 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1658.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner humbly prayes your Honours to take into conſideration the great and eminent advantages your Petitioner did this Common wealth in ſtaying this ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, at that juncture of time in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1652. for had that ſilver come into the hands of the Dutch, they would have laid it all out in powder and ſhot agaiuſt this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as we employed it againſt them, as will
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62073:21"/> appear by Col. <hi>Barkſteads</hi> Accompts, which moneys under God was a principal mean to reduce the <hi>Dutch;</hi> what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice this treaſure did the Nation in that juncture of time, <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> knowes, the <hi>Dutch</hi> then our enemies felt, and this Common wealth at this day enjoys the happy fruit of it.</p>
               <p>But had all advantages been home followed againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the laſt War, we had grubbed up their greatneſſe by the roots, and flayed his <hi>Zealand</hi> Lions skin, and broken their ſheaf of Arrows to ſhivers, making them unable for ever to trouble us, (but we only pared their nailes, and parted with them upon too gentle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and made ſuch a peace with them, that at this time they carry all our Trade from our Merchants in a manner, and do us more damage by being our feined friends, then they could do being our open enemies, the due conſideration thereof is humbly hinted here to your Honours. And if your Honours require a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Accompt, I can demonſtrate it to you in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

And at that time <hi>(viz.</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 30. 1643.) there was ſent and came from <hi>Oxford</hi> the Writs weekly under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> without any Countermand: My hard uſage After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62073:26"/> will hardly believe, had I not Printed it to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it may ſerve as a warning to prevent other Perſons, from beeing got in the like Snares for the future.] For this cauſe</p>
               <p>I Suffered Impriſonment in the <hi>Tower</hi> almoſt four years, for bringing up the aforeſaid Letter from <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Lord Mayor and Common Council of the City of London in <hi>December</hi> 1643. although I had an Order from the Houſ of Commons (as appears by their Journal Book) and a Paſs from the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Eſſex</hi> to go to <hi>Oxford;</hi> for an exchange for Mr. <hi>Heſilrigge,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrige</hi> his Brother, and I left my Exchange with Sir <hi>Arthur Heſilrigge,</hi> about the 2. of <hi>January</hi> 1643. which were both procured for mee by Mr. <hi>Theophilus Ryley</hi> Scout-maſter General of the City of <hi>London,</hi> who was authorized to execute that place by the Common Council of <hi>London;</hi> and I was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi> to do the ſame (Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi> being impowered by the Parliament and Common Council of <hi>London</hi> to hold Intelligence in any the <hi>Kings</hi> Quarters, as by his Orders hee ſhewed me:) Mr. <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> was a man of a known &amp; approved Integritie, and in great eſteem with the then Parliament and Citie of <hi>London</hi> at that time, and would not have acted any thing but what was Juſt, and for the Parliaments ſervice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Truſt. (If hee had thought it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if hee might have gotten a hundred thouſand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62073:27"/> pounds, upon my conſcience) and that made mee to act this Buſineſs, to bring up the <hi>Kings</hi> Letter upon his Intreaty (as hee confeſſed upon his Examination;) and I juſtified my doing thereof by his Order, hee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a publick Miniſter, and impowered to do it, as hee told mee. And alſo the Committee of both Nations was made acquainted with my going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the bringing up the ſaid Letter which I brought from the late King (by Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> Knight, I deſired him to make the Parliament acquainted therwith, before ever I went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to have their approbation;) which Sir <hi>David Watkins</hi> (after he had ſpoken with them) told mee, I had their approbation to go to <hi>Oxford:</hi> And all this was done before any Law or Ordinance was made or declared to forbid mee or any other to do the ſame (that ever I heard of:) or to this day can hear of, and I humbly ſay, That before a Law made, there is no tranſgreſſion, neither by Gods law nor Mans law. And I was not to queſtion Mr. <hi>Ryleys</hi> power, abilities and truſt, conſidering hee acted as a publick Miniſter, but to act according to his direction, ſo long as hee was in the ſaid Office of Scout-maſter, I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Warrant and approbation for doing what I did. I have never read nor heard of ſo heavy a puniſhment as your Supplicant doth ſuffer under, before a Law made to give a man warning, to take heed how hee Tranſgreſs.</p>
               <p>And by the Statutes of <hi>9. Hen. 3. cap 29. 5 Edw. 3. cap. 9. and 28. Edw. 3. cap. 3.</hi> No perſon (of what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62073:27"/> eſtate or condition ſoever hee bee) ſhall bee put out of Land or Tenement, nor taken, nor impriſoned, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, without being brought to anſwer by due proceſs of the Law; which I have Petitioned for, by a legal trial many years, but could never obtain the ſame.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſ your Honours, Had there been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation or Act of Parliament at that time to have prohibited mee, I ſhould have then been afraid; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi> ſhould never have made mee act againſt a declared Law, nor the King neither.</p>
               <p>Now, forasmuch as your humble Supplicant hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever ſince his Inlargement out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> made it his daily practice to ſtudy to ſerve the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and doing ſuch remarkable Services (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) for the Common-welath, I do moſt humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore your Honours moſt gratious Order for the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mee to my aforeſaid eſtate with damages, or the paying your Supplicant the ſumme of eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, according to the promiſe of the Council of State. 1652.</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Honours, If I would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied my Truſt to the Common-wealth, about this Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that was in the Ships <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> I could have had every penny of eleven thouſand pounds paid mee by the Claimers of the Silver in thoſe Ships; either in money here, or Bills of Exchange beyond

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>I had the Office of ſealing and ſurveying of all gold and ſilver Thread and Wyer: which prevented the making of all ſleight and adulterate gold and ſilver Thread, and Wyer, granted to mee under the Great Seal, for three Lives, from the Late King; which Office coſt mee Fifteen hundred pounds (to the Lord Treaſurer</hi> Juxon, <hi>L.</hi> Cottingon, <hi>Sir.</hi> John Cook: <hi>Secretary of State, and Sir</hi> John Bankes <hi>the late Kings Attourney. The neceſſitie of keeping up that Office, to prevent the daily Cozenages and frauds of divers Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

               <p>
                  <hi>And upon the Diſcovery of theſe notorious Cheats, 1635. (the late King and his Council appointed mee</hi> Surveyor <hi>and</hi> Sealer <hi>of the ſaid Manufacture) I cauſed all the abuſes to bee laid aſide: I indicted ſome offenders, impriſoned ſome, cauſed others to ſtand in the Pillory, and made many of them that wrought adulterate courſ ſilver run away out of</hi> London: <hi>By which means I angred many Cheating Wyerdrawers, Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Refiners: and the late Kings</hi> Council <hi>and</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners <hi>ſetled ſuch Rules and Orders, during the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Manufacture, as it was all made of good ſilver, and the Coin and Bullion of this Nation preſerved; and your Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant was bound, to the late King, to warrant all the Manufact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures either of gold or Silver, Wyer or Thread which hee ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſurveyed in the Office, to bee good ſilver, and to make it good to any party grieved in the Nation; as appears by my Patent under the Great Seal of</hi> England. For which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, Surveying and Sealing, I was allowed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and take an half penny for every ounce Troy, in Wyer, Spangles, Oes, &amp;c. I ſurveyed; and 4 pence for every pound weight Venice, for all the Gold and Silver Thread I ſealed with the Seal of my Office, being the Roſe and Crown. And all that time the gold and ſilver Lace, was as good Silver and as duly aſſaied as the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62073:31"/> Plate or Money of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and now it is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Rule nor Government, but the Wearers many of them cheated by courſe and deceitfull Lace, Wyer, ſilver Thread, as I can demonſtrate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I had a Grant from the late King, under his Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, to bee Maſter-worker of the <hi>Mint</hi> in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> for my life, with the Fee of five hundred pounds a year, for executing that place; which Grant was taken from my Mother, out of her Cuſtody, when I was ſent to the Tower.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I had one quarter part of the Lady <hi>Villers</hi> Farm at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> for the Importation of all gold and Silver Thread, Hatbands, Lace, and Copper, throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> which coſt mee, a little before I was ſequeſtred, above ſeven hundred pounds. And if the making gold and ſilver thread was put down in <hi>England,</hi> the Cuſtom of gold and ſilver thread imported would make a farr greater Revenew then now it doth by the Exciſe; and the Manufacture, if it bee made here, ought to bee kept to a ſtrict Regulation. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tbornbury</hi> I imploied to Collect this duty at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. I ſpent in my Impriſonment in the Tower for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt four years about eight hundred pounds, reckoning my Fees and Expences, and could never get Juſtice, though I petitioned to the Parliament as aforeſaid, for many years to come to a legall Triall, knowing my ſelf to bee innocent both by God's Law and the Laws of the Land; and by the teſtimony of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                              <p>I pray your Honours to conſider, whether I could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy men in this Diſcovery for two yeares, and not to pay them for their paines, and yet I have not had one penny for this ſervice.</p>
                              <p>Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> knew that I employed many people every day in theſe Diſcoveries, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of theſe being often with me, both at the Admiralty, and at his chamber; and he knew, I imployed none in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but credible perſons, as appears here under his hand.</p>
                              <p>And could Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> have made this Diſcovery, or known the tricks of theſe Merchants, Maſters of ſhips, and Purſers, by forged bills, and many other ſubtilties of Trade, which is not in his Law-books, but is common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Dutch Merchants in theſe times. Dr <hi>Walker</hi> would have ſaved me the labour and charge for employing people to make this Diſcovery, or from making my Proteſt in the Admiralty, and would have had the credit and thanks from the State for this Service and Diſcovery to himſelf. But this I dare ſay, though he be a great Lawyer, yet for the making of this Diſcovery, he was then 16. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1652. utterlie ignorant of the way to do it, this being a ſubtilty amongſt a few Merchants, and not to be read in the Civil Law-books, and had I not had all my Intelligence from their own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and plowed with their Heiſer, I could not have done this ſervice, or made this Diſcovery.</p>
                              <p>And upon examination of this buſineſs at the Councel of State, Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> confeſſed that it was not his ſtudy nor his place to ſeek up and down to procure Witneſſes, or to finde out waies to entitle the State to this Silver; and except I could bring legal Witneſſe, the State muſt loſe this Treaſure: this hee declared ſeveral times before the Councel of State.</p>
                              <p>But if the Paſſengers did confeſſe this Silver to be loaden, a great part of it for the accompt of Merchants of <hi>Anſterdam,</hi> as I had undertaken they would do, then hee would improve that Teſtimony to the uttermoſt for the States advantage, which indeed Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> did.</p>
                              <p>And I proved theſe frauds by the teſtimony of about ten of the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, being all Dutchmen, <hi>Hamburgers</hi> and <hi>Lubeccars,</hi> and other Hanſ-towns men; and I had above fourſcore witneſſes the Paſſengers and Merchants more to examine in this buſineſſe, many of them were after packed away by the Claimers, being Dutch marriners, and had money given them that they ſhould keep out of the way and not be examined, and ſeveral Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes waited many daies to be examined in the Admiralty and could not.</p>
                              <p>Spaniſh Gold and Silver was plentifully beſtowed on ſome in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, and they loved it well. The Claimers had their Inſtruments almoſt every night that ſtole ſilver out of theſe ſhips, to the value of many ſcore thouſand pounds, which I diſcovered to the Councel of State, as appeared by ſeveral papers which I preſented to them.</p>
                              <p>I imployed ſeveral men who ſpake the Dutch Language at my own charge, and gave them money to go on ſhip-board, and to drink freely with the Dutch marriners, and in their cups to fiſh out the ſecrets of this buſineſſe, and when I had once got the end of the ſtring, I would by other engines and inſtruments cloſely follow and never give it over till I knew the whole bottom of the Flemmiſh and Spaniſh cheats which they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put upon the Nation.</p>
                              <p>Theſe men that I imployed on ſhip-board for to make this Diſcovery for mee never appeared to mee in the Admiralty, leſt the Spaniſh and Dutch Merchants and marriners ſhould have diſcovered them to have been my ſpies. And to deal clearly with your Honours, they were none of them Book-men, Civilians, nor Lawyers, but ſuch perſons as be-<hi>skellom'd</hi> mee ſoundly in their cups with the Dutch marriners; and though I paid for the <hi>Brandey</hi>-wine, ſtrong beer, Mum, and Spruce beere, pickle Herrings and Holland cheeſe, yet I never exſpected from them good word or peny of money for all this charge and pains.</p>
                              <p>If I were to do the like ſervice again for the State, I would never look in any Books of the Civil Law, but conſult with ſuch perſons as know how to humour a Dutch Skipper or marriner, and fiſh out his ſecrets. Thus have I clearly told you the waies and inſtruments I uſed to do the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth this great ſervice. I now humbly exſpect according to the Councel of States promiſe the ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds for this ſervice. And had I not undertaken it the Common-wealth had loſt this Silver, which was to the value of two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds.</p>
                           </note> This that he deſires being just, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that you would not put him off, but let it be done forthwith unto himſelf, and all ſuch others as he under his hand ſhall nominate; for he employes others under him in ſearching into this buſineſſe. He will nominate none but ſuch as may be truſted in it. And I deſire you in your ſeveral places to give him, and all that he ſhall employ, all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſpatch and encouragement, that the buſineſſe of the Common-wealth may finde no obſtacle. Where there is publication, you may likewiſe ſhew him the Depoſitions and (I pray) let nothing that is juſt be denied him.</hi>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62073:47"/> charge of proſecuting the ſame in the Admiralty, your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner was neceſſitated to come to a certain agreement about his eſtate with the Councel of State, and how he ſhould be paid for this ſervice, or elſe it had been a thing impoſſible for your Petitioner to have undertaken this task, or to have gone through with it, in reſpect the Councel of State would not advance any money to your Petitioner, but would rather have let this ſilver go in the Admiraltie, as it had gone, had not your Petitioner in the very minute of time ſtayed it, as is atteſted under the hands of the Officers of the Mint, whereupon your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner was forced to borrow great ſummes of money, to enable him to employ inſtruments to finde out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this fraud.</p>
               <p>Several Gentlemen lent your Petitioner ſeven hundred ſixty five pounds at intereſt, every penny ſpent in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; the reaſon that both made your Petitioner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this difficult buſineſſe, and made theſe Gentlemen lend your Petitioner this money, was upon the credit and faith of the Councel of States promiſe to your Petitioner, that if this ſilver was forfeited to the State, your Petitioner ſhould faithfullie be paid out of the ſame the ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds, in lieu of his eſtate, and this you will ſee clearly proved, and my friends knew me ſo well, that I would not to fail of your Petitioners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and for that your Petitioner was and is ready to prove to the Councel of State, his damage is far greater by his Sequeſtration and Impriſonment then eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, the Councel of State did faithfully promiſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62073:48"/> 1652. that over and above the paying of your Petitioner the ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds, for this ſervice of getting and ſtaying this ſilver, your Petitioner ſhould have an Honourable Reward and Memorial left to poſterity for the ſame, and it was upon this ſcore of getting my eſtate again off Sequeſtration, or eleven thouſand pounds ſatisfaction, that I ever acted in this buſineſſe of the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or in any other publick buſineſſe from the year 1647. to 1651. or ſince 1652. to this time, for had I not been aſſured faithfully of my eſtate from the Councel of State, and relied on juſt performance; or had I had the leaſt thought of ſuch uſage, and putting off from day to day with References and Reports now my work is done; when my buſineſs, and what <hi>I</hi> deſerve is as well known (as the begger knows his diſh, or a man knows his right hand from his left.) I do humblie declare reallie to all the world, (I would have remembred that ſaying, a man may be over juſt) or elſe I would have taken more conſideration then I have done of my own preſervation, when I was offered ten thouſand pounds by the Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers for to have conniv'd and let the State be cozened of the ſilver in the Admiraltie, as they were at the time of many Dutch prize ſhips and goods. It could not enter into your Petitioners heart to exſpect ſuch delaies by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and old Court tricks; had I thought of ſuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I had known a waie to paie my ſelf. Had your Petitioner ſpent his ſpirits, time and eſtate to have ſtudied diſturbance and malignancie, as much as hee hath ſtudied the honour, peace, profit and welfare of this Common-wealth,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62073:48"/> the ſilver in the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George</hi> had never been coined in the Tower, being two hundred ſeventie eight thouſand pounds, but by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of ſome Merchants and others in the Admiraltie, had been cleared out of the Nation and ſent to the Dutch. Had your Petitioner <hi>December</hi> 16. 1652. at nine of the clock in the morning in the Court of Admiraltie been poſſeſſed with the dumb ſpirit of malignancie, your Judges of the Admiraltie that verie daie and hour had cleared the aforeſaid ſilver, the Admiral <hi>Van-Trump</hi> then lying on the Downes to have waſted the ſilver to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which had not your Petitioner prevented by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable applications to the Councel of State, might have prov'd of ſad conſequence, and have coſt many thouſand Engliſh mens lives, and God knowes what other dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to this Nation, ſuch an over-ſight in the Court of Admiraltie might have brought upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is very remarkable, the courage of Mr.</hi> Violet, <hi>in giving the Ambaſſador of</hi> Spaine <hi>ſo high a charge in 1652, 1653. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his undue practices to defraud the Nation of this ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And yet the Ambaſſador never to vindicate his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor to deſire reparation, he being here above a yeare after: This ſhews apparently there was a deſign ſet on foot by the Spaniſh Ambaſſador to defraud the Nation in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the ſilver Priſes, for when I ſee the Spaniſh Ambaſſador make no Addreſſes to the Parliament for reparation, I was aſſured Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>would make him let go his hold and claime of this ſilver mentioned in his Papers, which he delivered into the Houſe.</hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon peruſal of</hi> Mr. Violets <hi>Papers I obſerved, that though the Parliament was diſmiſſed 1653. the 20. of</hi> April, <hi>yet</hi> Mr. Violets <hi>ſore task continued on him ſtill, he being by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Council looked upon as the great wheel that ſet all on work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to the diſcovering part, and this appeares under the hand of Doctor</hi> Walker <hi>in ſeveral Letters writing to</hi> Mr. Doreſlaws, Mr. Bud <hi>the States Proctor,</hi> Mr. Arnold, Mr. How, <hi>to require them all in their ſeveral places to let</hi> Mr. Violet, <hi>and all ſuch as he employs under him have the full view and inſpection of all proceedings in the Regiſter of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to require</hi> Mr. Violets <hi>attendance, he paying ſeveral perſons, and expending in this buſineſs above five hundred pounds, as I finde it ſworne by ſeveral perſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is true for ſome reaſons of State Mr.</hi> Violets <hi>aſſurance and reward was uncommitted to writing to avoid claimers, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62073:53"/> miſconſtruction of lewd tongues, and to carry an even hand both in reſpect of the claimers, and the Spaniſh Ambaſsador: But this omiſſion was not to fruſtrate Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>of his dearly earned reward, the reſtoration of his Eſtate; many of the then Council of State, if they be attended by Mr.</hi> Violet, <hi>will ſay this could never enter into their thoughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſet a man ſo ſore a task; and ſtrictly to impoſe on him his daily attendance, and to enable him to undergo this great and heavy weight to be aſſiſted by ten ſeveral perſons, foure of them ſwear Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>expended, beſides all his pains, hazard, and labour, five hundred pounds in this ſervice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I am perſwaded had not Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>undertaken this buſineſſe in that very nick of time he did 13. of</hi> Decemb. 1652. <hi>and conſtantly and vigilantly followed, and agitated in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, both at the Council of State, and Admiralty; this great quantity of ſilver had been loſt, and the State deluded with pretended claimes, and how ſeaſonable a ſervice this was at that conjuncture of time, and the happy fruit and effect ſo great a treaſure brought to the Nation, is viſibly to all men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My opinion is that for the Honour (and I may ſay profit of this Nation, to encourage all men for the future to be faithful to the Common-wealth, and to expoſe their Perſons, and expend both their ſpirits and purſes for the Honour and ſafety of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, as Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>hath done in this great undertaking, and brought it to a happy iſſue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as the ſum of money was the greateſt that ever (I think) at one time was ſaved to this Nation by any one mans diſcovery,</hi> ſo his reward ſhould be ſutable, not only to have the ful reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Eſtate, which was faithfully, to my knowledg,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62073:53"/> promiſed to him, both by many of the Council of State and Parliament <hi>before ever Mr.</hi> Violets <hi>undertaking this ſervice mentioned in his Petition. But this ſervice being finiſhed, Crowns all his former undertakings, and in my opinion he not only deſerves the full reſtoration of his Eſtate, but to have an honourable memorial left to poſterity of his ſeaſonable and faithful diſcoveries and ſervices concerning the aforeſaid ſilver, That ſo all others may be encouraged to truſt to the faithful promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Council of State, when they ſhall ſee the States promiſes faithfully performed in ſuch a conjuncture of time, as when the Government was changed.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And I think I am bound in my conſcience, that taking notice of ſuch high propoſals as were propounded either in Parliament or Council of State, during the time I had the honour to ſerve the Publick (amongſt which I have and do hold this ſervice mentioned in Mr.</hi> Violets <hi>Petition to be one of the firſt rank that was ever preſented in Parliament or Council of State, when the work is finiſhed,) I hold my ſelf obliged, both in honour and conſcience to give the undertaker, ſuch as Mr.</hi> Violet, <hi>that hath in this buſineſs laboured all along to the perfecting of the work, The State having gotten by this diſcovery and undertaking, about three hundred thouſands pounds (as M. Violet affirms to me ſo much money coined) he having finiſhed his ſore task, I think I am bound in juſtice to help him what I can, that ſo after ſo great paines and hazard Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>might not work in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And upon this account I make this certificate, whereof one part is upon my own knowledge and experience I have had of Mr.</hi> Violet, <hi>the other Part I refer to the Orders of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Council of State, Doctor</hi> Walkers <hi>warrants, and the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of the Officers of the Mint.</hi>

                        <hi>I Can truly, and do certifie, That when the Caſes of and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Silver in the three ſhips, the</hi> Sampſon, Salvadore <hi>and</hi> St. George, <hi>were depending in the Court of Admiralty, touching the ſame being Prize. And before the Argument touching the caſting the</hi> Onus probandi <hi>thereupon in that Court were made; Mr.</hi> Thomas Violet <hi>did repair to the ſaid Court of Admiraltie, and to my ſelf, being Advocate to the then Parliament, and did produce from the then Council of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62073:54"/> State, one order bearing date the 13. of</hi> Decemb. 1652. <hi>And alſo ſome other Orders of the then Council of State, whereby he the ſaid Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>was ordered to repair to the ſaid Court of Admiralty, and alſo to my ſelf as Advocate for the then Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And to look after and take care of thoſe ſaid buſineſſes, touching the ſaid Silver in the ſaid three Ships or to ſuch effect, and accordingly hee the ſaid Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>was therein very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and induſtrious, and did by himſelfe and others imployed by him, and at his owne charge take great paines in following the ſaid buſineſſe, and in ſearching after, and examination of the ſaid Ships, Papers, and Bookes, and writings, and other matters that were exhibited into the Regiſters of the Admiraltie, and in making his obſervations thereupon, and collecting thereout what might make for the State, and looking after ſuch other evidences as hee could finde out, (wherein hee was noe way remiſs or negligent) and the ſaid Mr.</hi> Violet <hi>did openly owne the ſame buſineſs in Court, and moved therein on behalf of the Parliament, and that earneſtly and with zeal, and made or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome Proteſt therein in the ſaid Court of Admiraltie.

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62073:55"/> if hee had pleaſed, could have certified in this his Certificate, the day of the moneth I made my Proteſt againſt the Judges of the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie, being the 16.

But becauſe I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the liſt of the Dutch prizes, and diſcovered the abuſes and cheates put on the Nation by ſome Officers in the Admiralty, <hi>(no doubt but this buſineſs ſtuck in his ſtomack, and to gratifie ſome guilty perſons that had cozened the State)</hi> and that made him to certifie my buſineſs by halfs, and but part of his knowledge.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62073:55"/> ſo farr as my memory ſerves mee, which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by the veiw of ſeverall Orders of Parliament, Council of State, Certificates, Depoſitions, and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls formerly tranſacted in the Petitioners buſineſs, both concerning the Silver mentioned in the Petition, and ſeverall other of Mr. <hi>Violets</hi> faithfull ſervices done by him for this <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do ſignifie and declare, that from the yeare 1649. to the year 1653. being the time I had acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Violet,</hi> I obſerved that hee had a deepe profound judgement and inſight into the ſecrets of our Mint in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; knew the miſtery and ſecrets of other Mints in forreign parts, and the ſeverall Arts, miſteries, and waies forreign Nations uſed to induce and draw Bullion both gold and ſilver to their ſeveral Mints and Countries, and the Lawes and ordinances forreign Nations made for hindering the exportation in every reſpective Countrey.</p>
                     <p>And that both my ſelfe and others, my Aſſociates of the Council of State, in buſineſs of high and great concernments as to the Civil part, eſpecially concerning the Mint and Trade made uſe of him in many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſervices for the Publique.</p>
                     <p>And indeed for my ſelfe I muſt give him this juſt and due Commendations, that for all the time I knew him at the Council of State, hee was very diligent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the publique ſervice, as will appeare by the Acts of the Council in thoſe times, if recourſe be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto had.</p>
                     <p>Which actings of his, and his diligent attendance at
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62073:56"/> the Council of State, was in proſecution for many years to obtain his eſtate which was taken from him by the Parliament, as hee conſtantly affirmed both to my ſelfe and others, my aſſociates of the Council of State, when wee imployed him in many great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the <hi>Common wealth,</hi> and this dilligent and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant carriage of his, preſented him both to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Council of State, as a man whoſe abilities, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, reſolution and fideliry, was very neceſſary and ſerviceable for the benefit of the State, and great uſe was made of him in thoſe times by the State, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Silver buſineſſe, mentioned in his Petition.</p>
                     <p>And that to thoſe that knew him both in Parliament and Council of State, his truſt and faithfullneſſe was held in very good eſtemee, and his ſervices were eminently taken notice of both by my ſelfe and divers others, both in the Parliament and Council of State, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall years before Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> ingaged in this great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of ſtaying the Dutch Silver in <hi>December</hi> 1652. mentioned in his Petition.</p>
                     <p>And truly I muſt atteſt that both my ſelfe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall others of the Parliament and Council, looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. Violet in this great undertaking of ſtaying the Silver mentioned in his Petition, in the Ships <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> was the great wheele of the worke that got the State this great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for hee both diſcovered to the Council of State, the fraude of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, and the fraudes
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62073:56"/> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Claimers to the Silver, which ſeaſonable diſcovery of his at the Council ſtayed it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Proteſt in the Court of Admiraltie, being by him faithfully, and actively performed, the true At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation whereof was examined at the Council of State, and now ſhewed mee under the handes of the Officers of the Mint.</p>
                     <p>By all which proceedings it appeares to mee that Mr. <hi>Violets</hi> engagements in this ſervice, was not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall occaſion of getting the State this great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure mentioned in his Petition, but the only cauſe, and without him and his Proteſting in the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie at that very inſtant nicke of time 16. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1652. this great Treaſure being about three hundred thouſand pounds (as Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> affirmes to mee there was ſo much money taken out of the <hi>Sampſon, Salvador,</hi> and <hi>George)</hi> had bin all let go out of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and bin diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Court of Admiraltie, and of what preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and dangerous conſequence, ſuch an overſight in the Court of Admiraltie might have produced to this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> at that conjuncture of time, when <hi>Van Trumpe</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Generall was in the <hi>Downes,</hi> is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all men to conjecture, as alſo the contrary, the great advantage and benefit that hath accrued to this <hi>Nation</hi> by Mr. <hi>Violets</hi> happie and ſuccesfull Proteſting in the Admiraltie againſt the diſcharge of this Silver, and oppoſing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, and all their numerous intereſſed parties and Claimers, and their powerfull abettors joyned with it, the hard and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62073:57"/> taske hee impoſed upon himſelfe (as I finde it ſworne by ſeverall Witneſſes) and that beſides all his paines and hazards, hee expended in this ſervice above five hundred pounds.</p>
                     <p>And I finde by Doctor <hi>Walkers</hi> Warrants directed to Mr. <hi>Doriſlaus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bud,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Howe,</hi> the States Officers, and miniſters in the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, and by Orders of the Council of State, that ſince the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1653. Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> was required and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned not only to contribute his own endeavours, but alſo at his own charge to imploy many others in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this diſcovery, which I finde to be atteſted under Doctor <hi>Walkers</hi> hand, and by the Depoſitions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Perſons imployed by Mr. <hi>Violet,</hi> for that although the Parliament and Council of State were diſmiſſed the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1653 yet Mr. <hi>Violets</hi> fore taske, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, and dangerous imployment was impoſed and continued on him till the State had gotten the Silver, and this appears by Warrants from his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> Council, and Doctor <hi>Walker</hi> of a later date ready to bee produced, which I have ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Theſe actings of his, accompanied with great charge, hazard, and trouble, ſhewes to all the world Mr. <hi>Violets</hi> faithfull ſervice, conſtant fidelity, and love to his Country.</p>
                     <p>Upon due conſideration of all the premiſſes, I am very willing to teſtifie my knowledge of Mr. <hi>Violet,</hi> according to that true worth and great abilities <hi>I</hi> know in the man, with his readines to ſerve his Countrey,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62073:57"/> and I do it the rather becauſe hee had ſeverall times my faithfull promiſe (when I was a Councellor of State) that I would teſtifie his ſeveral ſervices done to the Parliament, by which I conceive hee merited the indempnity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of his eſtate before this great undertaking, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in his Petition about the Silver in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1652 but doing this ſervice ſucceſsfully in ſtaying this Silver, I thinke my ſelfe therefore now much more bound in honour and conſcience, after ſo longe a tryall of this mans patience, conſtancy, and fidelity, and his love to his Country, to give you my true obſervation of the man, both in his acting this and other great buſineſſe, and this I atteſt upon my knowledge and experience of the man, and not upon hear-ſay.</p>
                     <p>And if the rule of the Goſpel be obſerved, <hi>viv.</hi> that all men do to others as they would be done to themſelves, Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> cannot be many weekes without a full reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Eſtate or the value, and if Mr. <hi>Violet</hi> hath had ſuch meaſure as he hath preſented to the world in print, ſurely I muſt ſay he hath had hard meaſure, but I wiſh him not only his Eſtate, but alſo an honourable memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to be left to Poſterity of his great ſervice, according to former engagements to him by ſome of the then Council of State, for this particuler ſervice of the Silver mentioned in his Petition, this juſt due and deſerved Teſtimony, I do give him this firſt of <hi>October</hi> 1657.</p>

                     <p>We finde the Petitioners debts and engagements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the proſecution of this buſineſſe of the Silver Ships to be very great, amounting unto the ſumme of ſeven hundred ſixty five pounds, and upwards, which the Petitioner oweth at intereſt at this day.

I have formerly ſhewed unto moſt of you the Orders of Parliament touching this buſineſs, and what endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were acted by Mr <hi>James Steneer,</hi> and ſeverall other Merchants, to cozen the State of all this great treaſure: All the printed Tranſactions moſt of you have ſeen formerly, But the orders that mentions ſeaven ſeverall Letters of Mr. <hi>James
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62073:70"/> Steneres,</hi> and ſeverall other Merchants Letters which were read in Parliament. Mr. <hi>James Steneer</hi> writes to his Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents beyond Seas concerning the geting them this Silver out of the Admiraltie, (wee, meaning himſelfe and the reſt of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, have made a great many friends among the great ones to ſpeake for us in the buſineſs when it comes before them, (a wiſe man may gueſs who thoſe great ones were, and what great ones made a trade by cozining the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in their Priz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es) the Claimers of the ſilver at that time having ſtollen ſeveral ſcores of thouſand poundes out of theſe Ships, ſo that they weree full of money and they could bribe any Perſon in power that would be corrupted, in another of Mr <hi>Steneres</hi> Letter that was read in the Parliament Houſe, Mr. <hi>Stenere</hi> writes to his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents beyond Seas, that he muſt have a care what hee did write to them touching this Silver buſineſs, left his Letters ſhould be opened, when he was brought to the Parliament Barr the firſt of <hi>December</hi> 1652. he rather choſe to act the part of a foole, and a lyer, rather then to ſerve the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this deſign, for which tampering of his the Parliament committed him from the Barr to the Serjeant at Armes the firſt of <hi>December</hi> 1652. as appeares by the journals of the Parliament, at that time <hi>Van Trumpe</hi> the <hi>Dutch Admirall</hi> was in the Downes, and no doubt but his mouth watered after this Silver, there is a Commiſſion under the great Seal of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the originall orders of the States Generall. Upon the petition of the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to guard theſe ſhips and ſilver from the Parliaments forces, which will remain to poſteritie to ſhow the juſtice of this Nation in ſtaying this ſilver for Dutch ſilver, the truth of this being alſo confeſt in the Admiraltie by many of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62073:71"/> 
                  <hi>marriners and paſſengers which came that Voyage from</hi> Spain, <hi>and that the Purſers books and many of the Bills of Lading were forged and altered at ſea after that they had heard certainly by ſome ſhips that the Dutch were at warrs with</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Parliaments Agent at</hi> Cades <hi>gave advice here to Mr</hi> Wilſon <hi>his kinſman, the day that theſe ſhips ſet ſaile from</hi> Cades, <hi>and though they gave out there that they were to go for</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>yet their deſigned Port was</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>they being loaden for the greateſt part upon the account of the Dutch, and the ſame was confeſt in the Admiraltie by many of the Paſsengers and others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Decemb. 14. 1652. <hi>The Spaniſh Ambaſſador</hi> Don A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo de Cardenas, <hi>Embaſſador extraordinary for the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>came in perſon to the Parliament, and made an Oration in the Houſe, claiming all this ſilver in theſe three ſhips to belong to his Maſter and for his Maſters ſubjects account; which Speech hee alſo at the ſame time preſented to the Parliament in writing both in Spaniſh and Engliſh, together with two bundles of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers touching this ſilver, which hee referred to the conſideration of the Houſe: And for ſeveral daies hee made his appearance at the Council of State, and put in the like claimes for this ſilver, hee ingaging his Honour that no part of it did belong to the Dutch, as will appear by the proceedings and the records of the Council of State, and Mr</hi> Stenier <hi>was bayled, and his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe never called on to this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While theſe buſineſſes were tranſacted at the Parliament, Councel of State, and Admiraltie, I made the Lord</hi> Bradſhaw <hi>and many of the Council of State acquainted with the whole pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and fraud that was intended to be put on them by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62073:71"/> parties, and that if they had not a ſpecial care, the Judges in the Admiraltie would diſcharge this ſilver, and the Dutch had rather it ſhould be in the bottom of the ſea than wee ſhould have it. Upon this Information the Council of State commanded mee to attend carefully the motions of the Court of Admiraltie and the Merchants touching this Silver, and from time to time to give the Council an account what was done in the buſineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereupon,</hi> December 15. 1652. <hi>I made the Council ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, That the Judges of the Admiraltie had appointed to bring theſe ſhips,</hi> Sampſon, Salvador <hi>and</hi> George, <hi>their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and lading to a judgment the next day, being</hi> Decemb. 16. <hi>in the Admiraltie; And that I did believe the Judges would cleare the ſhips, the Lord</hi> Bradſhaw <hi>and ſome others of the Council askt mee what reaſon I had to ſay ſo or to ſuſpect ſo: Whereupon I told them, the Commiſsioners of Dutch prize Goods had given me a warrant to go aboard theſe Dutch prize ſhips when I pleas'd, and to imploie whom I thought good to get acquaintance with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aboard theſe ſhips. And I had certain intelligence, that</hi> Otho George, <hi>Captain of the</hi> Sampſon, <hi>had commanded all his men to be in readineſſe and had taken in freſh victualling and biskets, and that in a few daies they ſhould be at</hi> Dunkirk, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that</hi> Van Tromp <hi>would do them no hurt though hee were on the Downes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon this diſcovery, many of the Council of State did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the great dammage and danger the Nation was in if this great treaſure ſhould fall into the hands; of the Dutch, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much debate I was commanded by the Council to attend in the Court of Admiraltie,</hi> Decemb. 16. <hi>all the while the Court ſate, and if the Judges did go about to clear the ſilver, then I
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62073:72"/> ſhould make my Proteſt againſt their proceedings, till my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were examined that ſhould diſcover the fraud: And the Councel likewiſe charged mee, That if the Judges askt mee by what authoritie I made my Proteſt, I ſhould deny I had any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Councel of State but I ſhould do it upon my owne peril and account, if I were certain I could diſprove the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ambaſſador, and if I did prove that there was ſilver aboard theſe ſhips belonging to the Dutch, out of the first hundred thouſand pounds that was coined of this ſilver, I ſhould be paid eleven thouſand pounds, being in lieu of my eſtate that I had for many yeares petitioned for, whereupon I told the Council the eſtate the Parliament took from me, endamaged me above ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, many of the Councel replying (Perform you what you have undertaken, which we believe you are never able to do) and you ſhall have an honourable reward for this ſervice, over and above eleven thouſand pounds which you claim for your eſtate. I have done this ſervice, and two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds the State hath had, and employed it for the deſence of the Common-wealth, in paying the Army and Navy, as will appear by the Accounts of Coll.</hi> Barkſtead; <hi>yet to this day the Council of State hath not performed their faithful Promiſe to me, to pay me eleven thouſand pounds, and to give me an honourable reward over and above for this ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very remarkable, that there was a deſigne laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome of Mr <hi>Steniers</hi> great ones to cozen the State of this Treaſure; and would I have been Knave, I might have been one of his great ones, and have taken ten thouſand pounds to let the ſilver go, as in this Book is cortifiedby many honourable perſons might have had.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62073:72"/>
               <p>And that to ſome in the Admiralty, my appearing in that Court to ſtay this ſilver was moſt diſtaſtfull and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and ſpoiled ſome peoples markets both in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie and other places too; for ſome of the Judges in the Admiralty, <hi>(Exton</hi> and <hi>Stevens) Decem.</hi> 16. 1652. were ſo farre from giving mee thanks for my diſcovery, and for making my Proteſt in the behalf of the State to ſave this ſilver (which had not their intereſt and profit layen another way they ought to have done) but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe openly in the Court before many hundreds of merchants have reviled mee and would of diſcharged this ſilver.</p>
               <p>And had I not received a command from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State the day before to act in that manner, to be ſure to keep the Judges from diſcharging the ſilver, let the Judges ſay what they pleaſed, the Iudges would that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning have diſcharged the ſilver, and conſulted together to commit mee; they diſputed the buſineſſe ſo lowd, that I and many others heard it: And the Iudges bid <hi>Wyeen</hi> the then Regiſter of the Admiralty call on the ſhips <hi>Sampſon, Salvador</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> not minding what I ſaid: this can be proved by many merchants, and is fully certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Officers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I told Mr <hi>Wyeen</hi> the Regiſter, that if he and the Iudges did diſcharge the ſilver in theſe ſhips, and did not forbear their ſentence till my Witneſſes were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I would make it the deareſt daies work they ever did in their lives or to that effect. And I undertook before the Iudges in the Admiralty upon the peril of my life to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62073:73"/> the <hi>Saniſh</hi> Ambaſſador and <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> Claimes to this ſilver. Whereupon Monſieur <hi>Motett</hi> (the Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Secretary) hearing mee ſay ſo to the Iudges, was in a very great rage, and ſo were all the reſt of the Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I told the Iudges, that if they would clear the ſilver, notwithſtanding my Proteſt, before my witneſſes were examined, it was moſt apparent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was betrayed, and bribes given and taken by ſome great ones to cozen the Common-wealth of this ſilver, but it ſhould not be in their power to do it, for I would prevent them.</p>
               <p>And that if the Iudges did proceed to diſcharge this ſilver, and that this ſilver come into the hands of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Iudges lives and eſtates could not make the Common-wealth ſatisfaction; for that <hi>Van Tromp</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> General was then on the Downer, and an haſtie Iudgment, before the truth of this plot was diſcovered, would put this ſilver into the <hi>Dutch</hi> mens power, which might be of ſad conſequence to this Nation, and may coſt many thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> men their lives. VVhereupon all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> Claimers were in a great rage, heat and diſcontent.</p>
               <p>Two of the Iudges <hi>(Exton</hi> and <hi>Stevens)</hi> told mee I had undone my ſelfe for ever, in making my Proteſt againſt the diſcharge of the ſilver, and by my other actions and words that day in the Admiralty; and ſo the Iudges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded mee to attend the Council of State that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: And ſo the Court broke up, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62073:73"/> 
                  <hi>Flemmings</hi> curſing mee bitterly, and I exſpected every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute to be murdered by them.</p>
               <p>The Iudges of the Admiralty propheſied truer then <hi>Lilly</hi> hitherto; for they told mee the ſtaying of this ſilver would undo mee: for if the Council of State do not pay mee the eleven thouſand pounds they promiſed mee, I have by my faithfulneſs, honeſty and integrity to my Countrey in the proteſting againſt the diſcharge of this ſilver in the Admiralty, and by my conſtant, chargeable and dangerous proſecution thereof, in getting the State two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pound, in refuſing the Claimers money, when they offered mee ten thouſand pounds to be ſilent and let the State be cozened of the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: VVould I have been a knave I might have been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among Mr <hi>Stenieers</hi> great ones, but my faithfulneſs to my Countrey in this particular ſervice (if the State be not juſt to mee in their promiſe) will undo mee for ever.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have formerly delivered a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of ſome of your names, and the ſummes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I borrowed of you to to enable me to do this great ſervice, all my owne Eſtate being under a ſequeſtration, unto the Commiſſioners that were appointed to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine this buſineſſe.</p>

               <p>Firſt, what the State and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> hath got, and the conjuncture of time when Van Tiumpe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Generall with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets was in the <hi>Downes,</hi> and at that very time <hi>I</hi> was offered by the Claimers of this Silver, great Merchants of <hi>Flanders</hi> who was then in London to get this Silver out of the States hands, <hi>I</hi> have proved that theſe very Claimers ſeverall times offered me the ſumme of ten thouſand pounds, to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the State to be cozened of this Silver in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, and had <hi>I</hi> not eſteem'd and valued, the peace and proſperity of this Nation above my life, <hi>I</hi> would have

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> ſhall humbly deſire the Parliament and Council of State to conſider how many ſuch malignants there is in the three Nations <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> if the Parliament could but finde a covee of ten ſuch malignants in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions of <hi>Wales,</hi> to bring them in two hundred ſeventy eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds every one of them as <hi>I</hi> have done, ſuch a ſumme of money would pay the debts of the Publique, if they can finde none of the breed but my ſelf, I humbly deſire then to preſerve me for a Phenix, and to pay me eleven thouſand pounds which <hi>I</hi> have ſo cleerly proved they owe me, and give me a Commiſſion to go a Kite-catching for the Common-wealth, <hi>I</hi> ſhall humbly preſent them with a great number of pretended godly Buzzards, who ſince the year 1640. have cozened the Common-wealth of many hundred thouſand pounds, <hi>I</hi> ſhall humblie ſhew them the wayes how they have done this, and finde out the men who from the bottome of baſeneſſe and beggerie, have by unjuſt waies accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to themſelves vaſt eſtates, in theſe diſtracted and trouble ſome times, to the ruine of many thouſands of families, whoſe cries for their oppreſſions have aſcended up unto Heaven, and no doubt but is the principal cauſe of theſe ſad diſtractions and diviſions that are now amongſt us.</p>

               <p>For I feared the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Claimers would kill me for ſtaying this Silver, but that was a needleſſe fear, for God hath kept me, I put my truſt in man and thought aſſuredly, that it could never enter into the hearts of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Council of State, but thankfully and honourablie to pay me what they had promiſed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and I ſo dearly earned, which was for getting them two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62073:76"/> and this ſome of you will atteſt, when required to be true, beſides it grieves me to the Soule more for ſome of you, who out of good will to the <hi>Nation,</hi> borrowed great ſummes of money for me, and at this day are ſued for the ſame and muſt pay it, that I ſhould be made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to Trappan you or any honeſt man for your good will to your Countrey, to cozen you of your money.</p>
               <p>It is true my body is at your ſervice to impriſon in a Goal, but it is money that you expect, and not my fleſh or bones.</p>
               <p>How ſhamefull a thing would it bee, that it ſhould be left to poſterity, that <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> that ſaved this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds, all imploied in the defence of the <hi>Nation,</hi> at ſuch a time the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> was in Jeopardie, and in great ſtreights for money, diſcovering this Plot the ſame day the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the Admiraltie would have diſcharged the Silver, and then it had bin preſently conveyed to our enemies the <hi>Dutch.</hi>

                  <hi>I pray God for the honour of this Nation, and of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, that the Council of State take order for my ſatisfaction, and indeed I am perſwaded in my Conſcience, when the Council ſees theſe Tranſactions atteſted by a multitude of honourable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and my ſervices ſo great, that never any man of my quality had the like Conteſt with mightie men, and brought it to ſo happie ſucceſs as I have don, that I ſhall be truly paid eleven thouſand pounds, and the Damages will be conſidered for the forbearance of my dearly earned reward ſo long from 1653 to 1659.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen, I have preſented to you the hardeſt uſage that you or I can expect, and if I be not juſtly and honourably dealt with, let fortune doe her worſt, I will truſt and wait on Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and tide out theſe troubleſom times, ever keeping this rule where I receive Protection there will I pay obedience, let it be to

               <p>I now think it convenient to give you an accompt, by what waies I humbly propound to be paid by the Parliament and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State this ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds, and to take no money from them, but to bring them in greater ſummes of money, and alſo advantage the Nation many ſcores of thouſand pounds, and fill the Nation with great Treaſure of gold and ſilver, the Soldiers delight, and the Merchants darling, being that which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all things.</p>

               <p>A Painter may ſhew you the Colours before he workes, but the craft is in mixing and grinding them, and handling the pencel that makes the Picture.</p>
               <p>There is not one man of a hundred thouſand that could, or can go through with this buſineſſe, but the undertaking of it would brake his neck. It was God that inabled me, and kept up my ſpirits, and ſo he doth at this day, or elſe it had bin impoſſible but I ſhould have ſunke under the weight of ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>The ſhewing you a Watch, and painting, inables you not to make either, without long ſtudy, Tooles and materialls.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee both the Theorick, and the practick part, that I have and can ſerve my Countrey.</p>
               <p>And me thinkes that rule in common Juſtice ſhould be allowed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62073:77"/> to me, that haveing made my proofe-piece as it is amongſt moſt Lawyers or Tradeſmen as a reading ſhews a man well verſt in the Law, an excellent Picture once finiſhed makes a man an approved Painter, and ſeverall prizes ſkilfully played approves a man maſter of defence.</p>
               <p>I humbly preſent unto the Parliament and Nation, my getting the Common wealth this two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds to be my proof-piece, to ſhew to poſterity, that the Garden of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath too few ſuch malignant <hi>Violets,</hi> that would voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture life, credit, and what is above life, have morgaged all my well-being for the future for fifteen hundred pounds to ſave this Nation, and refuſed ten thouſand pounds when I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be bribed.</p>
               <p>Let any juſt man conſider of what I have done, and no man can deny me this reward of eleven thouſand pounds, that hath honeſty, honour, or Conſcience.</p>

               <p>God deliver all good honeſt minded men from ſuch Machiavel-villains, but I hope better things that St. <hi>James</hi> his rule ſhall be remembred, ſhew me thy faith by thy workes, that I that have worked in the Vinyard of this Common-wealth all my time, ſo ſuccesfully for the profit and honour of the Nation

               <p>To conclude, have you but patience till the next Term, and ſuch of you as have commenced your ſuits go no further, put not your ſelfe and me to expence and trouble, till I get the Council of States Anſwer to this booke, I here promiſe you all, ſuch of you that will have my perſon, next Terme willingly to ſubmitt to your Executions, and if the Council of State will ſuffer me to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a priſon alive, for the money I expended to get the State two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds, and at that time ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured my life in the buſineſſe, ſuch oppreſſions will ſtinke in the noſtrills of all good and juſt men, but I hope better things, and truſt the Council of State will be more carefull of the credit, and faith of the Nation.</p>

               <head>THE POSTCRIPT. <hi>The Wayes I humbly propound to the State to pay me this debt, are theſe, in which Emploiment the Common wealth will get twenty times more advantage then I, as appears,</hi> Viz.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I Have at this time three Bonds in my Cuſtody, which were out of my poſſeſſion twelve yeares in the Committee of <hi>Shropſhires</hi> hands at <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which bonds are in two thouſand pounds for the payment of me one thouſand pounds, and taken from my Siſter Anno. 1643. who kept them for me, theſe bonds were due in 1644. I paid <hi>John Corbet</hi> Eſquire a member of this preſent Parliament forty pound, to have theſe Bonds delivered to me by the Committee of <hi>Salop,</hi> which money I paid by command of the Council of State, as appeares in this book Fol. 27. 28. 29.</p>
               <p>I only humbly deſire and pray for an Order, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Parliament to confirme the ſaid Order of the Council of State, and that I be impowered by Order of Parliament to ſue and to implead the ſaid Bonds, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I might have done, notwithſtanding any Order, or Ordinance of Parliament to the Committee of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> or any other Committee touching or concerning theſe Bonds, in regard I have paid the Committee of <hi>Salop</hi> forty pounds for them as aforeſaid.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:62073:79"/>
               <p>And I ſhall thankfully allow and accept of theſe three Bonds for two thouſand pounds in part of payment of the ſumme of eleven thouſand pounds the Council of State promiſed me. Gentlemen, for your Comfort theſe Bonds are good Bonds, and the men Solvant that owe me the money, and the money is doubled at ſix in the hundred at this day, and I have men of fifteen hundred a yeare tyed for the payment of me of theſe Bonds at long running, though now they keep out of the way, they ſhall pay me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wheras I had an Office for Regulating gold and ſilver thread, as appeares in this Book, Fol. 110. 111. 112. and had I not bin diſturbed in the due Execution of the ſaid Office by ſeverall Clamorous cheating Silkemen, Wyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawers, and Refiners, who <hi>I</hi> have proved to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament make it a common Trade to cozen the wearers of gold and ſilver Lace, as I can atteſt it under the hands of Mr. <hi>Alexander Jackſon</hi> ſworne aſſay Maſter of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Hall, and other perſons in a hundred parcells.</p>
               <p>The Refiners and Wyer drawers of gold and ſilver within this twenty yeares, have culled and melted down the heavieſt coines of Shillings, Sixpences, halfe Crownes, and Plate of this Nation, to above the value of a million of Silver, to the great weakening of the Stock of currant Silver money, the great decay of Trade, and unſpeakable loſſe to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>I have, and can produce to the Parliament a Certificate of the Committee of Trade dated the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1657. upon many days examination of all theſe abuſes, <hi>I</hi> have it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62073:79"/> certified to the Parliament the ſeverall daily cheats of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-drawers put on the Nation, and the Committee for Trade recommended me <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> to the Parliament to be reſtored to my Office with ſuch fees as <hi>I</hi> received for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and certifie the great miſcheifes which is daily practiſed for want of this Office.</p>
               <p>And that I ſhould be ordered to put in ſecurity in the Exchequer in ſuch ſummes as the Parliament pleaſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point me, to warrant all gold and ſilver Wyer that ſhall be aſſayd at the Office to be fine Silver, and not under ſterling, and all gold and ſilver Thread to be juſtly and duly made, with a due proportion of Silke, and <hi>Thomas Violet</hi> to pay the damages to any perſon greiv'd or wrong'd, that buy gold or ſilver Thread, or Lace ſurveyd as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>And to prohibit all Refiners, and other perſons the melting down the currant Silver coines, or Plate of the Nation, for any of theſe manufactures upon ſevere penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Committee recommend me to the Parliament, I ſhould have the power as formerly to make ſearches, and deface all adulterate gold and ſilver Thread and Wyer, and the Committee Certifies this Regulation of the reſtoring me to my Office, would increaſe the ſtock of Silver in the Nation above thirty thouſand pounds a yeare, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Order I have ready to produce.</p>
               <p>And if the Parliament by their Order impower me to Execute that Office again, and confirme me in it for two lifes, which coſt me fifteen hundred pounds before I could get the grant under the great Seale from the late
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62073:80"/> King, (which money I paid to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Juck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr Atturney General <hi>Banks,)</hi> if I have this Office againe, I will increaſe the ſtock of Treaſure every yeare above ſeventy thouſand pounds a year, whereas now as this manufacture is made, without a Rule, it waſtes the ſtock of Treaſure thirty thouſand pounds a year, and this I will maintaine, prove, and demonſtrate it to your Honours to be true, this manufacture being under no Rule and Government as it is at this day, is one of the back doors that hath brought ſuch a ſcarſity and want of currant Silver money on the Nation, and had it ever come to Examination in Parliament as now I deſire it may, I will prove it is more profitable to the Nation to keep money in peoples purſes, then vainly to bruſh and loſe thirty thouſand pounds a year of men and womens cloaths, as is Certified by a Committee of Parliament it now doth.</p>
               <p>I will demonſtrate this Nation had better have given at this day one hundred thouſand pounds to me to have kept up this Office to a due Regulation, then have put down my Office, by the doing thereof they have had a million of money leſs in the ſtock of the Nation then they ſhould have had, had my Office continued, if the Parliament pleaſe to impower me to Regulate this manufacture, and to receive the fees I took formerly, I humbly will accept of it for two thouſand pounds ſo I may have it for two liſes, in part of payment of the eleven thouſand pounds which the State owes me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have for many years attended the Committee of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62073:80"/> Mint about Regulating their Mint, as is well knowne to many members of the Council of State what charge and time I ſpent in this ſervice, I complained of this buſineſſe eleven yeares ago, and for your further ſatisfaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend you to Fol. 11. 12. 13. 14. in this book, there you will ſee the true Reaſons ſet down how it comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that no ſilver and gold is coyned in the Tower.</p>
               <p>And that the Parliament, I will Juſtifie, had been better to have given the two Doctors <hi>Gourdon,</hi> and <hi>St. John,</hi> forty thouſand pounds for a Pention, then have imployed them in their Mint, that it is not in the power or ſkil of Doctors or Apothecaries ever to ſet the Mint at work as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated: that had I not ſtayed two hundred ſeventy eight thouſand pounds which was coyned by my proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, this ſum was as much money as hath bin coined in ſome ſeven yeares in the Tower, ſince the Maſter-worker and Warden had that imploiment, I have humbly offered if the Parliament pleaſe to command me and pay mee for my paines, that I will make the Mint cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly go, and cauſe every year ſome hundred of thouſands of pounds to be coined, to the honour of the Nation, and increaſe of the ſtock of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Provided I may have the place of Maſter-worker and Melter, with the uſuall fees formerly allowed to them ſetled under the great Seale, and that I may be impowered by Orders and Warrants from the Council of State from time to time for to ſee the due execution of my place, for the inabling me to do this ſervice. This buſineſſe to effect is very troubleſom and chargable.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62073:81"/>
               <p>And will be of mighty concernment to the State, for their ſervice, as you will ſee in this booke, by filling the Nation with Treaſure and money, the blood and ſinews of Commcrce and Warr, what makes ſo generall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of want of Trade, but want of money, and people have not monies to pay the ordinary and neceſſary charges, and if the State do not look to ſettle this buſineſs ſuddenly, this miſcheif for this many years I have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to the Parliament in Print, and <hi>I</hi> knew would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come upon us.</p>
               <p>It is a certain Maxime, Not any private perſon, or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth can ever be capable of effecting any great buſineſſe that is not rich in monies, or cannot command great ſummes of money, either of his own, or upon his Credit.</p>
               <p>I pray read and conſider what I have ſaid concerning this buſineſſe in this book, Fol 11. 12. 13 14. if the State im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me here in the Mint, I will remove all theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and ſet the Mint a working, and this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if I have it for my life, I will humbly accept of it at the value of two thouſand pounds, in part of payment of my ſatisfaction of eleven thouſand pounds, and by my induſtry and care will increaſe the States Stock every year ſome hundred of thouſand of pounds of Silver, which now comes in, and is ſtollen out.</p>
               <p>I would never undertake to do this diffiult buſineſſe, were <hi>I</hi> not aſſured there is none in the Nation can do it but my ſelf, and till the State imploy me, this work will never be done effectually.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62073:81"/>
               <p>Three of you Gentlemen are great mints men and Gold ſmiths, and know the difficultie of this undertaking, and I dare affirme before you, none of you will trouble your ſelves to finde out the bottom of theſe difficult waies that muſt be uſed to do this ſervice, not for ten times the profit I ſhall receive by this Emploiment.</p>
               <p>Therefore I humbly deſire to have an act to injoy the place of Maſter-worker and Melter for my life, provided I do this ſervice within three moneths after my grant, this miſcheif is come to a gangrene, and the Council of State muſt make ſharp and ſtrict Orders in this buſineſſe, or elſe this miſcheif cannot be remedied, a great deal of care muſt be uſed to put theſe Laws in Execution, elſe there wil be a perpetual conſumption of the Stock of the Nation in the Silver coines, as it is come already on the Gold coines, you ſhall not receive in a thouſand pounds one twenty-ſhillings-peece in Gold, and in few years there wil be the like defect in the Silver, not ſo much as will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commerce, and Trade, pay Rents and Taxes, nor to go to Market.</p>
               <p>The firſt Sluce-gate that muſt be ſtopped, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the melting of gold and Silver currant coins of the Nation, for gold and ſilver thread it is true there is a Law againſt it, but who looks after the Execution, Execution is that that gives life to the Law.</p>
               <p>The like courſe muſt be taken againſt the Tranſporting gold &amp; ſilver out of the Nation, it is true old Laws forbid it, but who makes it their buſineſſe to diſcover the offenders</p>
               <p>Had the Act paſſed in the Houſe which I proſecuted
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62073:82"/> againſt Tranſporting Gold and Silver, and <hi>I</hi> impowered and imployed as <hi>I</hi> humbly propounded ten years ago, this Nation had had at this day millions of Silver which is now Tranſported, to the great damage of the Nation.</p>
               <p>This Act hath bin twice read in the Houſe, ten times Committed, Referred to the Committee of the Navies, Officers of the Mint, Officers of the Cuſtomes, all their Reports and Certificates certifie that if the Parliament will not paſſe this Act, and appoint able skilfull perſons to make it their buſineſſe to hinder the Tranſporting Gold and Silver, the ſtock of Gold and Silver in the Nation would be all Tranſported, and this Nation expoſed to very great inconveniences by not preventing it, who can or could ſay more then theſe Certificates ſay.</p>
               <p>If the Parliament pleaſe to paſſe this Act, I will ſpend my time and paines, and in that ſervice, take theſe Tranſporters in the nick of their action, and confiſcate the monies, had <hi>I</hi> Warrants and did ſet my ſpringes I would catch theſe Woodcocks, my experience would be of great advantage, for an old Dear ſtealer is the beſt keeper of the Park, and it is not unknown to ſome of you that almoſt thirty yeares ago <hi>I</hi> was queſtioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Tranſporting Gold and Silver, I diſcovered a neſt of Tranſporters of Gold, and the King ingaged me to do that ſervice, I cauſed them to be fined twenty foure thouſand one hundred pounds, in the year 1635. in the Starr Chamber, as appears by the Records, and made Alderman <hi>Gibbs,</hi> and Sir John <hi>Wollaſton,</hi> glad to Petition and pay well to the late King for their Pardons, for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62073:82"/> abuſes done in their Trades, and this was the true ground of <hi>Gibbes,</hi> and <hi>Wollaſtones</hi> revenge againſt me.</p>
               <p>When in the yeer 1643. they maliciouſly and Knaviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged honourable Gentlemen to preſent me to the Parliament for a malignant, and to ſend me to the Tower, and ſequeſter my Eſtate, to my damage at this day twenty thouſand pounds, only to work their malicious ends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, when at that time they had Trappaned me, to catch me as a man catcheth a Partridg with their Lowbel, Mr. <hi>Theophilus Rily</hi> who decoyed me into this ſnare to undertake to bring up from <hi>Oxford</hi> the Letter from the Late King Charles, mentioned in this Book, Fol. 33.</p>
               <p>And then to aggravat it againſt me with that Violence to ſome honourable members of Parliament, that it had like to coſt me my life, and I ſuffered almoſt four years impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment in the Tower, and had my eſtate ſequeſtred to my damage of twenty thouſand pounds as appeares in this Book, Fol. 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Petitioned the late</hi> Protector <hi>Richard for to give me and ſome others I nominated in truſt for my uſe, the grant of making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon farthing, as appeares in this booke Fol. 118. 119. 120. 121. 122. the late</hi> Protector <hi>accordingly gives me</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the grant of the ſame for 31. years in part of my reward for this ſervice of ſtaying the Silver, and orders the Solicitor Generall to attend the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Approbation, who are deſired to ordain and appoint ſuch Rules, Prohibitions, and Penalties, for the effectuall, and better management of this ſervice, the preventing of all former abuſes, and reſtraining the importation and Counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any the ſaid farthings from the parts beyond Sea, as they

               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall humbly deſire the Parliament, to give me the grant for the ſole making of a Publique farthing for 31. yeares of the value and weight aforeſaid, and I ſhall humbly and thankfully accept of this imployment as the value of five thouſand pounds towards my debt of eleven thouſand pounds, and if the Parliament pleaſe to have a farthing made lighter, yet as heavy againe as the common farthings, I ſhall make a common farthing to go currant in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and I will pay unto the maimed Solders five ſhillings upon every two and twenty ſhillings that is uttered in the Office, and accompt, truely upon Oath, this will be a great revenew to the maimedSolders, and I will be bound to accompt monthly to the Treaſurers of the maimed Solders, which will be about three hundred pounds a moneth for ſome years.</hi>
